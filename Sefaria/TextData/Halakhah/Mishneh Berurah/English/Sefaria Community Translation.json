            "The essence of the mitzvah of delight in Shabbat is explained to us by the prophets, as it says: “and you shall call the Sabbath a delight,” and there are authorities who believe that the essence is from the Torah, for Shabbat is part of the times that are called holy...as is explained in the Sifra...And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118)...And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them. And since in general, most people get their delight from meat and wine and sweets, therefore we learn...that one should have a lot of meat and wine and sweets according to one’s abilities."
