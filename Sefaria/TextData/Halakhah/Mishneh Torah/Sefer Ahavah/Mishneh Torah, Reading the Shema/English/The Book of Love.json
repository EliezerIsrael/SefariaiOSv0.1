            "The Shema is recited twice every day, once in the evening and once in the morning, as it is said: Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up (Deut. 6: 7). The time when people customarily lie down is evening and the time when people customarily get up is morning.",
            "What does one recite? The three paragraphs beginning with the words Hear (Deut. 6:4-9); If, then, you obey (Deut. II: 13-21); and The Lord said (Num. 15:37-41). The paragraph Hear is recited first because it contains commandments concerning God's unity, the love of God, and the study of God, which is the basic principle on which all depends? After it, If, then, you obey, is recited since the passage commands obedience to all the other commandments. After that, the paragraph concerning the fringes is recited, since it also contains a command to recall all the commandments....",
            "Even though the commandment of wearing fringes does apply at night, one reads the passage because it has a reminder of the Exodus from Egypt. It is a commandment to recite the Exodus from Egypt as it is stated: So that you will remember the Exodus from Egypt all the days of your life (Deut. 16:3). These three sections ordered as such form the recitation of the Shema.",
