            "The sages forbade eating the bread of idol worshippers because of the concern of intermarriage. Rema: and even in a situation where there is no concern of intermarriage, it is [nonetheless] forbidden. (Rashb\"a §248) However, they only forbade bread made from the Five Grains (wheat, barley, oats, rye, spelt), but bread made from legumes or from rice or millet is not in the category of \"regular bread\" which they forbade. Rema: It is also not forbidden on account of [being] \"Idolaters' Cooking,\" if it would not be served at kings' tables (Tur and Beit Yosef in the name of the Rosh's responsa).",
            "There are places that are lenient about this, [where] they buy bread from an idolater's bakery in a situation where there is no Jewish bakery, since this is considered a \"time of pressing need.\" Rem\"a: And some say that even in a place where \"Jews' bread\" can be found, it is permitted (Beit Yosef following the Mordechai; Sefer Mitzvot Hakatan; Hagaot Ashri; Mahar\"i; Issur VeHeter §44). But regarding personal bread, no-one rules leniently, since the essence of the decree is because of the concern of intermarriage, and if one eats the bread of [idolatrous] home-owners, he will come to dine by them. Rem\"a: However, it is not called \"personal bread\" unless he made it for the people of his own household, but if he made it to sell, it is called commercial bread, even if he doesn't normally [sell bread]; conversely, a baker who made [bread] for himself, it is considered \"personal [bread].\""

            "If one mixed a food that is eaten even raw with a thing that is eaten when raw and a non-Jew cooked them – if the essence is of the food is subject to the prohibition of non-Jewish cooking, it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted. Rema: And it is permitted to eat roasted peas of a non-Jew, and also the roasted legumes (which are called “arbiss”), for they are not served at the kings table And thus they treat them leniently if it is not in a place where they grease the metal frying pan with forbidden fats, then the custom is that they are prohibited. But otherwise it is permitted, and one need not worry about the vessels of non-Jews because most vessels have not been used in the last 24 hours. And any fruit that is eaten raw, even if a non-Jew cooked it, and it was mashed up and made into a cooked dish in their hands, it is permitted. Therefore, we eat the fruit mash made by non-Jews.",

            "There are those that permit cooking by our non-Jewish maids, and those that forbid, and even after the fact. Rema: And after the fact, you should rely on those that permit. And even initially, we are accustomed to be lenient with a Jewish house that has non-Jewish maidservants and menservants that cook in the Jewish house, because it is impossible that no one in the house would protest even a little if they were to cook incorrectly.",
            "Non-Jews that cook, and do not intend to cook, this is permitted. How? A non-Jew that lights a fire in a swamp in order to chase away the locusts, and some of those locusts become cooked, these are permitted, even in a place where they are served on a kings table. And thus if he singed the head of an animal, it is permitted to eat the tips of the ears that became roasted at the time of the singeing. But if the non-Jew intended to cook, for example that he lit the oven to cook in it, and there was some meat in there already which became roasted, even though he did not intend to cook the meat, as he did not know it was there, it is forbidden.",

Therefore, if one wants to cook in a pan in an oven of non-Jews, it is necessary that the Jew puts the pan in himself, to a place in the oven that is appropriate to cook in. Rema: And there are those that disagree and believe that lighting a fire or stoking the coals in any way with regards to cooking, as with bread, is sufficient, and that is our custom. And even stoking the fire without any particular intentions works. And there are those that say that even if the Jew did not stoke the fire, and did not throw in any wood chips, only that the non-Jew lit the oven from a fire that was lit by a Jew, that is permitted.",

But large salted fish are not edible except in pressing circumstances. Therefore, if a non-Jew roasted them, they are forbidden, and there are those that permit this. Rema: And thus anything that is edible when raw only in pressing circumstances, and a non-Jew cooked them, the rule is like large fish. And meat that is salted is not edible at all when it is raw, and it is forbidden if it is cooked by a non-Jew.",
            "Fish salted by a non-Jew and fruits that are smoked until they are fit to eat, these are permitted, because salting is not considered like boiling for the purposes of this injunction, and smoking is not like cooking.

And even for those that require the dishes to be made kosher, if it is a clay vessel, it should be placed into boiling water three times, and that is sufficient, because there is nothing that is forbidden here according to the Torah. Rema: A non-Jew that cooks for someone who is sick on the sabbath, it is permitted after the sabbath, even for those who are healthy, and there is no concern here of the prohibition of non-Jewish cooking, because in any case, it is recognizable what this is."

And it is not forbidden except in the place of its sale, but if he brings the alcoholic beverage to his home, and drinks them there, it is allowed, since the essence of the decree is that perhaps he will dine with the Gentile. And the sages only forbid it when he has a set place for drinking as people are wont to do, but if he enters the house of a gentile and drinks there in a temporary manner, it is allowed. And so too one who stays overnight in the house of a gentile, it is thought of as his house, and one is allowed to send into the city to buy alcoholic beverages from the idol worshipers. Rama: And there are those who permit the alcoholic beverages of honey and grains, and it is the custom to be lenient in our countries.",

What are we talking about? When one buys in a shop; but if he sees the shopkeeper bring it from the barrel, it is permitted, and we are not concerned that perhaps wine was mixed in, because if wine would be mixed inside the barrel, it would ruin the product. Rema: And even though that it is normal is to rub the inside of vats with lard, there is no concern as this gives off a ruined flavor, which is also nullified in 60, and also there is no concern that they would put wine in the drink. And see chapter 134 in a place that they are accustomed to put blood or other forbidden things into the salt, or ink, if it is permitted or forbidden.",
            "Pomegranate wine that is purchased for it's healing properties, is permitted to be bought from the merchant, even if it is not from the barrel, even though that it has a superior appearance to that of wine, because since that people are careful about medicine, they will not want to risk their own careers over this.

Rema: And if it is normal to put yeast in, then it is forbidden to buy from them if the drink does not have at least 60 times the amount of yeast. And that is only if it does not contribute to the taste, for if it is for the taste it would not be nullified, even with 1000 times the amount of yeast.",

And so olives that are soaked in brine are permitted, even if they are very soft as they are disgusting in their natural state, and we do not suspect that perhaps they have adulterated them with wine, and this is only if they do not cut them with their knives. Rema: Because after they have been soaked they are spicy and shall absorb flavors from the knife. But if they are soaked in non-Jewish containers, they are permitted because after they put water in them to nullify the spice. And so too with anything similar, and see above in chapter 96.",
            "Grapes of non-Jews, even if they are very wet and have cracked, they are permitted. And so all soaked things that it is not their way to put wine or vinegar in them. And so too with kosher fish. And so too fish brine that has fish in it. And so too asafoetida is permitted.",
            "It is forbidden to buy asafoetida from non-Jews if it is cut with their knives which have come into contact with non-kosher food, and so too with mixtures of fish, because small unkosher fish gets into the mixers and it is impossible to separate them, and they sometimes place wine to soak in the mixture. And this is forbidden to eat, but to benefit from it is permitted. And if it is known that they put wine in all of these, then they are forbidden even to benefit from. Rema: And you can sell them all, except if it has non-Jewish wine in it. And if it is known that a non-Jew will later be in a city where they do not mix wine, even though that other non-Jews are accustomed to do so, this is permitted to buy from them, as long as you don't know for certainty that they have mixed wine in, because we rely on this lenience that perhaps they have not mixed anything in. And so too for anything like this that is forbidden rabbinically. And if it is known with certainty that some non Jews mix wine in, and some do not mix wine in, then we go according to the majority, as it is unusually for a person to deviate from the norm. But it is forbidden to buy from them when they are at home, because one half is just like the other half in this regard.",

            "Milk that was milked by non-Jews and no Jew saw them do so, it is forbidden as perhaps non-kosher milk was mixed in. If it was milked in his house and a Jew was sitting outside, if it is known that there is no non-kosher animal in his herd, it is permitted, even if no Jew is able to see him at the time that he milks the animal. If he has a non-kosher animal in his heard, and the Jew sits outside, and the non-Jew is milking only for the sake of the Jew, even if the Jew is unable to see him when he is sitting, if he is able to see him when he stands, this is permitted, because the non-Jew fears that perhaps he will stand and be seen, and he knows that non-kosher milk is forbidden the to Jew. Rema: Initially, it is necessary for the Jew to be there are the beginning of the milking and check to make sure that the bucket is empty and does not contain non-kosher milk. In any case, after the fact there is no need to be concerned for this. And regarding maidservants that milk domestic animals in the Jew's house or in his neighborhood are not, they are not suspected of milking non-kosher animals. But if a non-Jew takes a break, the Jew needs to be there, because it is like the case of the non-Jew's house. And even a Jewish child will suffice, because the non-Jew appears before him. In any case, if a Jew is not present until after he has finished milking, this milk is considered the milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, even thought no non-kosher animal exists in his herd. Milk of a non-Jew makes vessels non-kosher when they are cooked in them, just as any prohibited food, even though this is only an uncertainty whether he has mixed in something non-kosher. And so too with non-Jewish cheese, but not non-Jewish butter, even in a place where it is considered prohibited it does not prohibit vessels when cooked, and it is not a problem if it becomes mixed; if it is mixed in that which is permitted, everything is permitted, like above regarding the bread of non-Jews. See above in chapter 112. Milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, it will not work to make it into cheese or butter afterwards, rather it remains forbidden, and everything that is made from it is forbidden.",
            "Cheese made by non Jews was forbidden because that they are produced with the dried stomach of an animal that was not correctly slaughtered. And even when the cheese is produced using vegetarian rennet it is forbidden. Rema: And thus is the custom, and it must not be changed, unless you are in a place that has permitted this since earlier times. And if a Jew oversees the production of the cheese and the milking, it is permitted. And thus is the custom that spread in all of our countries. And if a Jew oversaw the making of the cheese, but not the milking, it is permitted after the fact, because there is no concern that perhaps something non-kosher was mixed in after the cheese was made from the milk, because non-kosher milk will not allow the cheese to form, and of course the non-Jew did not mix anything in once he knew it was for making cheese. And in any case, it is forbidden to eat such milk.",
            "Butter of non-Jews, there is no question that such a thing is permitted. And if the majority of a place treat it as forbidden, this cannot be changed. And in a place that has no particular custom, if the butter is cooked until the milk solids come out, this is permitted. Rema: Also it is permitted to cook it in this fashion initially in order to get the milk solids. And if a non-Jew cooked it, it is permitted, because most vessels have used in the past 24 hours. And if one goes from a place where this is not eaten, to a place where they do eat it, he should eat it with them, but it is forbidden to bring it with him and eat it in a place where they are accustomed to forbidding it. If the butter is not recognizable as being from such a place, it is permitted. And one who goes from a place where this is forbidden, to a place where it is permitted, it is forbidden to eat it there. And there are those that say that the law is the same if he brought it from a permissive place to a prohibitive place, that this is also forbidden, even if it is recognizable, and such is the custom."

And so there is no concern that perhaps the non-Jew smeared the cheeses with lard. Rema: And there are those that say that we should not permit it if he forgot the stamp in the house of the non-Jew, unless he left it on the cheese that he himself made, but if he left it like so, and there is a concern that perhaps the non-Jew cut the cheese smaller, and then switched it with another large piece of cheese or something better, it is forbidden. And in a situation of loss, we should be lenient in any case."

And if one is a house-guest with him, he may not eat from his foods for which he is suspected. Rema: And there are those who say that even for someone who is not suspected, but rather that we merely do not know him to be established regarding keeping kosher, it is forbidden to buy from him wine or other things for which there is a concern about prohibited items. In any case, if one is a house-guest with him, he may eat with him.",

And thus if he sends food to your house, it is permitted, because it is persumed that he would not eat something strange to him, and someone who succumbs to temptation is not considered suspect.",
            "One may give his food to the one who is suspected of eating non-kosher items in order that he should fix or cook them, and there is no concern that he will switch them, since he is not suspected of outright robbery. And if it is given to someone who is zealous about his actions, and he is suspected of eating non-kosher, it is forbidden, as perhaps he will damage what he was given and then switch it out with his own food. How? If one gives something to his father in law who is suspected regarding forbidden things, it is forbidden, because of the shame of marriage, and he wants to make his daughter look good, and therefore he will switch out something bad with something good. And thus if one gives something to an innkeeper who is suspect, sometimes he is embarrassed of his guest and will switch something bad for something good. (And in any case, it is permitted to deposit items with him and they should be in the same state as when they were deposited).",
            "One who is suspected for one thing is not suspected for other things, but he is suspected for anything that is required to perform that thing. For example, one who was suspected of selling prohibited animal fat instead of permitted fat, and he would get youths to come buy from him by providing nuts, they fine him so that he could not sell even nuts.",

If he said, \"I bought it from so-and-so the cheesemaker,\" he is believed. If he brings a gift from the cheesemaker, he is believed, because he is not suspected of switching products. About what are we speaking? When there is no suspicion of outright robber, but if he is suspected of this, then he is suspected of switching products. And all this is not regarding someone who is suspected of breaking Torah laws.",

RAMA: Rather, one [i.e., a Jew] should be distinct from them [i.e., non-Jews] in one’s manner of dress and in all of one’s actions. But all of this [i.e., these restrictions] apply only to things that non-Jews do for the sake of licentiousness. For example, they are accustomed to wearing red clothing, which is official/princely clothing, and other clothing that is similarly immodest. [These restrictions also apply] to things that they are accustomed to doing because of a custom or rule that does not have a[ny underlying] reason, out of concern that [a Jew who does such things will follow the] “ways of the Amorites,” and that it has the blemish of [i.e., is tainted by] idol worship inherited from their ancestors. But things that they are accustomed to doing for a useful purpose—such as their custom for expert doctors to wear particular clothing so that the doctors will be recognized as specialists—one is permitted to wear [such clothing]. Similarly, things that are done out of respect or another reason, it is permitted [for one to do such things]. And therefore they said one may burn [the items of deceased] kings, and there is not in this “the ways of the Amorites.”",
