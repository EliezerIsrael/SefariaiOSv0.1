If the upper left minor lobe is larger than the upper right minor lobe - terefah.  Similarly, if the major right lobe is larger than the left - all this is called 'reversed' and is terefah.  The roseate small lobe - if it's absent, or if it's on the left side - kosher.

Similarly, if its appearance or shape differs from the norm - terefah.  If there are two roseate lobes with a common finger-thick base: even though it has a crack, it's kosher.

One who is in danger of a great loss can be lenient (beit yosef), and if it was just rinsed a little before salting it is acceptable after the fact. This is the rule if the piece of meat is 60 times the volume of the blood that is on it (Sharei Durah in the name of the Mahari). If one salted an unwashed piece of meat with other pieces of meat, the other pieces are acceptable and the unwashed one is forbidden (aruch).",

If they are only salted on the inside or on the outside, and likewise with pieces [of meat] that are only salted on one side, these are permitted. Gloss: And there are those who forbid this even after the fact, and this is the custom if there is no great need for the meat [i.e. to feed guests, or shabbat is starting soon. This means that it is permissible to use meat salted on one side even from the outset if there is a need for it.]. But if the meat hasn't been cooked, one should not cook it as is, but if it's within 12 hours of having been salted should instead salt the second side that hasn't been salted and then cook it afterwards. If it has been after 12 hours of being salted then one should roast it on the fire, and the fire certainly draws it [i.e. the blood] out, and the side that was salted won't absorb [blood] from the side that wasn't salted.",

Gloss: And this is authoritative after the fact, or even from the outset [if the meat is needed in order to] to honor guests or for the needs of Shabbat. But, without this [need] the custom is to wait with the meat being salted for the length of an hour, and this cannot be changed.",

The vessel should be washed between each and every rinsing [of the meat]. Gloss: And there are those who say that the meat needs to be washed three times and this is the custom from the outset, therefore if one washes or shakes off the salt from among it and washes it twice, this is like washing it three times. Or one places the water in the vessel and afterwards places the meat in it and washes it three times. And this is the custom from the outset, that one gives lots of water in the first rinsing in order to nullify the strength of the salt that's in the brine. It's permitted to wash the meat in fruit juice, and water is not required. ",

Rema: Even a small amount of water will negate the strength of the tzir. (Aruch, klal 6 and Mahari). There are those who permit [the meat] even if there was no water in the vessel when the meat was placed there since we aren't concerned about the short amount of time while the person is washing the meat. (Share Durah). We can rely on this. We only worry about all this for the first washing, but after the first washing there is no concern. (Such are the words of the Mordechai and the Ran). And there is no difference between washing in a vessel that is kosher, non-kosher, or dairy. As long as there is a little water in the vessel to negate the strength of the salt so that it is not cooking, even if the vessel is dairy or non-kosher, or dirty with forbidden things. (Aruch).",

If there was in all that is in the pot, the pieces, the vegetables, the soup, and the spices, enough that this piece is one in sixty [or less] of the whole, the piece is forbidden and the rest is permitted.

But if it was stirred from beginning until end or was covered from the time of [milk] falling in until the end, everything joins together to nullify the taste of milk. <i>Therefore, if it wasn't stirred at all, not at the beginning and not at the end, and wasn't covered at all, if there is sixty in the pot compared to the drop of milk that fell in, it only prohibits the piece alone, and the rest of the pot is permitted (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ra'avid and Magid Mishnah in the name of the Rambam.) And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.  And if there is no non-Jew to taste and be relied on, we measure with sixty (until now, the language of the Rambam.)  <i>There are those who disagree and reason that stirring the pot isn't effective unless it's stirred immediately after the prohibited matter fell in, and this is our practice.</i>   ",
