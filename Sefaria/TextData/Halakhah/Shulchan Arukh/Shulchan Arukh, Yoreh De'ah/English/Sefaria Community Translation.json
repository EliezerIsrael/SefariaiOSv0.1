(Share Durah). We can rely on this. We only worry about all this for the first washing, but after the first washing there is no concern. (Such are the words of the Mordechai and the Ran). And there is no difference between washing in a vessel that is kosher, non-kosher, or dairy.

(49) [82] The vessel into which the tzir fell is forbidden, [83] Therefore if the vessel was dairy (50) and is dirty, the meat is forbidden since even after the salting time it is considered roseiach [84] however if it is a case of great loss and needed for a mitzvah (51) one may be lenient and say that once the required salting time has passed, it is no longer considered roseiach. (52) [85] According to his words even though meat sat in salt its required time, one may not eat it until it is washed off well. It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered. Rema: [87] And some permit it to be cut with a knife after it went through it’s required salting time [88] for salt can not affect vessels [89] and it is indeed permitted [90] but the knife must be washed off [91] or thrusted into the ground if the tzir has already dried. Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) ",

But if he didn't remove it before it was able to exude the milk it absorbed, even if a non Jew tastes it and it has no taste at all, it's forbidden unless there is sixty.  <i>See chapter 98 (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 98) that we aren't accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-Jew and we need sixty every time.</i> ",

If there was in all that is in the pot, the pieces, the vegetables, the soup, and the spices, enough that this piece is one in sixty [or less] of the whole, the piece is forbidden and the rest is permitted.

And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.  And if there is no non-Jew to taste and be relied on, we measure with sixty (until now, the language of the Rambam.)  <i>There are those who disagree and reason that stirring the pot isn't effective unless it's stirred immediately after the prohibited matter fell in, and this is our practice.</i>   ",
