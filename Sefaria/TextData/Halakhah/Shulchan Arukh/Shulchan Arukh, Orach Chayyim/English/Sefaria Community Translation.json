When Purim falls out on Friday, they should have the meal in the morning because of honor for the Sabbath (Minhagim). And one who wants to [have his meal] every [Purim] in the morning is allowed to (T\"H). Some say that there is [significance] to eating seeds on Purim as a remembrence for the seeds that Daniel and his friends ate in Babylonia (Kol Bo). It is good to delve a bit in Torah before one begins the meal, and a support for that is (Esther 8:16) \"The Jews had light and happiness...\", which we learn out \"radiance\" - that's Torah (Mahariv). One is obligated to drink a little and be a little happy on two days, the 14th and the 15th (Minhagim), and so is the custom. And some say that if one causes damage to his fellow through his happiness on Purim, he is exempt from restitution (T\"H Siman 110). And see T\"H Laws of Damage.",
            "One says \"Al hanisim\" in the Grace After Meals during the blessing of the land [\"Nodeh\"]. And if one started his meal during the day, and extended it into the night, he [still] says \"al hanisim\", for we follow the [status of] the beginning of the meal. And some say one should not say it. Rama: And we have the custom like the first opinion. ",
            "One must send to his fellow two portions of meat, or foodstuffs, as it says (Esther 9:19) \"And send portions, man to his fellow.\" Two portions to one man [is the obligation]. And anyone who send more to his fellows is praiseworthy. If he has none, he can trade with his fellow, this one sending to that one his meal, and this one sending to that one his meal, so that they can fulfill \"And send portions, man to his fellow.\" Rama: And some send the portions during the day and not at night (from the Rosh, first chapter of [Bavli] Megilla). And if one sends portions to his fellow, but he doesn't want to accept them, or he forgives him [his obligation], he fulfills [his obligation nonetheless]. And a woman is obligated in [sending] portions to the destitute and sending portions [to one's fellows] like a man is. A woman sends to a woman, a man to a man. But not the other way, so that a man does not come to send it to a widow, and it will come to a possibility of kiddushin [having been enacted]. But portions to the destitute one should not worry [about this possibility]."

            "One may do work [which is forbidden on the Sabbath] on Purim, but places that have the custom not to should not, (Rama: And today, all places have the custom not to (Kol Bo)), and anyone who does will never see blessing from that work, unless it is a joyful building, such as a house for a newly-married son, or an arbor for kings and officers. Rama: And it is permitted to do work for a mitzva, such as writing Torah law decisions. And similarly it is permitted to do even work in the fullest sense for the needs of Purim (T\"H Siman 112).",
