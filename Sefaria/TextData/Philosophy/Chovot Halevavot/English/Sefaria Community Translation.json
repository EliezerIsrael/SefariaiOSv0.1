                "The definition of the wholehearted acceptance of the unity of G-d is that the heart and the tongue are equal in acknowledging the unity of G-d, after understanding, in the way of logical proofs, the certainty of His existence and the truth of His unity. For acknowledgment of the unity of G-d among men differs according to their level of intelligence and understanding. ",
                "Among them: One who declares the unity (of G-d) with only his tongue, namely, that he hears people say something and he is drawn after them without understanding the meaning of what he is saying.",
                "Among them: One who declares the unity of G-d with his heart and tongue, who understands the matter of what he is saying through the kabala (tradition) that he received from his ancestors, but he does not understand the clarification of what he received of this matter, and the truth of what he believes in this matter.",
                "Among them: One who declares His unity after understanding through logical proofs the truth of the matter, but he will conceive G-d's Unity like other unities to be found, and he will come to form a material conception of the Creator and represent Him with a form and likeness because he does not understand the true nature of His Unity and the matter of His existence.",
                "Among them: One who declares G-d's unity with his heart and with his tongue after understanding the concept of true oneness and temporary oneness, and he can bring proofs to demonstrate G-d's existence and true oneness - this class of men is the complete (unblemished) group regarding the matter of unity of G-d.",
                "Therefore, I defined the wholehearted acknowledgment of the unity (of G-d) - that it is the equalizing of the tongue and the heart in the unity of the Creator, after one knows how to bring proofs on it and understands the ways of His true Unity through intellectual investigation.
