                "<b>In the beginning God created.</b> This is per the verse (Prov. 3:19): \"God with wisdom founded the earth\" and when the Holy One Blessed Be He created His world, he consulted the Torah and created His World, as it says (Prov. 8:14) \"I have counsel and sound wisdom, I am understanding, I have strength.\" And with what was the Torah written? With black flame on white flame, as it is said (Song of Songs 5:11) \"his hair is wavy, black as a raven.\" What is meant by קוצותיו תלתלים (\"his hair is wavy\")? That on every קוצ (thorn)^(that is, every serif of every letter of the Torah) hang  תילי תילים (locks and locks) of laws. How so? It is written in it [the Torah] (Lev. 22:32): And do not desecrate [תחללו] My holy Name. If you change the [ח] to a [ה] you destroy the world ^(by making techalelu into tehalelu, and making the verse mean do not praise My holy Name). \"Every soul shall praise [תהלל] God\" (Psalms 150:6), if you change the [ה] a [ח] ^(techalel - shall desecrate) you destroy the world. Likewise, (Deut. 6:4) \"Hear O'Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One [אחד].\" If you change the [ד] to a [ר] you destroy the world, as it is said (Exo. 34:14) \"You will not bow down to other gods.\" [Elsewhere it is stated] (Jer. 5:12) \"They have belied Hashem.\"  If you change the [ב] to a [כ] you destroy the world. [Elsewhere it is stated] (Shmuel I 2:2) \"There is none holy as Hashem.\"  If you change the [כ] to a [ב] you destroy the world. And if just a letter is like this, how much more so a whole word. For this is it stated, \"his locks are like tresses.\" Therefore Dovid praised and said, (Psalms 119:96) \"Your commandment is exceedingly broad.\" [Likewise] it is said (Iyov 11:9) \"the measure thereof is longer than the earth...\" And it [the Torah] was the guide for all creation, as it is said (Prov. 8:30) \"then I was by Him, as a nursling.\" Do not read it as אמון [nurseling], but rather as אומן [guide].",

                "<b>Behold, Thou has driven me out..., Hashem said unto him, \"Therefore whosoever slayeth Kayin ...\"</b> There are those that say He closed the Shabbos before him, as it is said (Exo. 31:17) \"a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever.\" Just like Shabbos found worthiness in Adam, the first [man], so too did it find worthiness in Kayin. And there are those that say a horn was affixed to his [Kayin's] forehead. When Kayin killed Hevel, [Hevel] was discarded [on the ground] and Kayin did not know what to do. So the Holy One, Blessed is He, sent him two pure birds and one of them killed his fellow, and then dug the earth with its claws and buried it [the dead bird]. From this Kayin learned and dug and buried Hevel. Therefore, the birds have merited that their blood be covered [with earth].",

                "...R. Levi said: The whole twelve months that Noah was in the ark, neither he nor his family tasted sleep because they were responsible for feeding the beasts, animals and birds. R. Akiva said: Even branches for the elephants, and little shards of glass for the ostriches, they brought it with their hands to feed them. Now some animals ate in the second hour of the night and some in the third hour of the day, hence you know that Noah did not taste a bit of sleep. R. Yochanan said: One time, when Noah was late in feeding the lion, the lion attacked him, and he went away limping..."
