            "The superintendent said to them: “Say one blessing,” And they blessed.  They recited the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:2–13 (20:2–14 in NJPS) or Deuteronomy 5:6–17 (5:6–18 in NJPS)), “Hear, [O Israel . . .]” (Deuteronomy 6:4–9), “And it shall come to pass, if you hearken . . .” (Deuteronomy 11:13–21), “And the Lord spoke . . .” (Numbers 15:37–41).  They blessed the people with three blessings: “True and enduring” [the blessing that follows the Shema prayer in the morning prayer service], Avodah [the blessing that many Jews say as part of the Amidah prayer calling for Divine acceptance of the Temple service], And the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24–26).  And on the Sabbath, they added a blessing for the [priestly] watch that was leaving.",
            "He [the appointed Kohen] said to them: The new [Kohanim who have never offered] the incense, come and draw lots. They drew lots and the one who won, won. He said to them: The new and the old [Kohanim], come and draw lots [to determine] who will bring up the limbs from the ramp to the altar. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: The one who would bring up the limbs to the ramp, he would be the one who would bring them up to the top of the altar.",
            "They [the ones who lost the lottery] were given over to the caretakers. They would remove their [priestly] garments and would not leave anything on except for their pants. And there were holes [in the wall, used for storage of the clothing] and the purpose [of each hole] was written on it.",
            "The one who won [the right] to [offer] the incense would take the [golden] pan. And the pan was similar to the great Tarkav (measuring utensil) of gold, and it could hold three kav (Mishnaic volume) and there was a golden container (a smaller pan) [that would be] filled with incense. And there was a cover to it and a small [decorative] cloth was hanging hang on it from above",
            "The one who won [the right] to [bring the] shovel [with incense to the sanctuary] took the silver shovel and went to the top of the [copper] altar and stirred the coals and scooped [some coals] He went down and arranged it [by emptying them] into the [shovel of] gold. A kav (Mishnaic volume) of coals would scatter [when the coals were transferred, because the gold shovel was smaller than the silver one]. And he would sweep them to the ditch. And on Shabbas [when he couldn't touch the coals more than necessary, lest he extinguish them] he would cover them with a Psachter. And the Psachter was a big vessel that could hold a letech (large Mishnaic volume) and there were two chains [attached] to it, one that he would use to pull it as he was descending [the altar's ramp with the ashes] and one that he would grab from on top it in order to prevent it from rolling [off the altar's ramp]. And it was used for three things: they would cover the coals [on Shabbas] or a Sheretz (one of eight species that produce spiritual impurity when dead) [found] on Shabbas. And they would lower the ash [with it] from on top of the altar.",
            "...They [the Kohanim designated to bring the incense and the coals] arrived at the area between the antechamber of the sanctuary and the [copper] altar (a place of higher sanctity than the rest of the courtyard) and one took the Magraifa (musical instrument) and through it between the antechamber and the altar [to make a loud noise [as a signal]. No one could hear the sound of his friend in Yerushalayim because of the [loud] sound of the Magraifa. And [its sound] was used for three things: A kohen who heard its sound knew that his brother Kohanim were [currently] entering [the sanctuary] to bow [as they offered the incens] and he would run and go [to join them]. A Levi that heard its sound knew that his brother Leviim were entering to sing the [daily] song and he would run [to join them]. And the head of the [Israelite] representative (there was a rotation of Israelites to represent the rest of the Jews during the temple service) would gather the impure people at the eastern gate.  "
