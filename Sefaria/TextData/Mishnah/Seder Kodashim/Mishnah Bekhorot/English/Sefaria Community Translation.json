As it is written \"in Israel\" (Bamidbar 3:13), but not by others. Priests and Levites are also exempt due to a foritori argument - if they exempt a Israelite [who is neither priest nor Levite, while the Jewish people were] in the desert, then certainly it is the ruling that they would exempt themselves.",
            "If a cow gives birth to [a creature which] looks like a donkey, or a donkey gives birth to [a creature which] looks like a horse - it is exempt from the laws of the firstborn, for it is written \"firstborn donkey\" (Shemot 34:20) and \"firstborn donkey\" (Shemot 13:13) -  two times, [to teach that] the birthing [mother] be a donkey, and the born [creature] be a donkey. And what about eating them? A pure species which gives birth to [a creature which] looks like an impure species, it is permissible to eat; an impure species which gives birth to [a creature which] looks like a pure species, is forbidden to eat, for that which comes from an impure species is impure; that which comes from a pure species is pure. If an impure fish swallows a pure fish, [the pure fish found inside] is permissible to eat; if a pure fish swallows an impure fish, [the impure fish found inside] is forbidden to eat, for it is not its product.",

[If it gave birth to] a male and one to a female, he sets apart one lamb for himself. If two donkeys that both have not previously given birth now give birth to two males - one must give two lambs to a priest; If these two donkeys gave birth to one male and one female, or to two males and one female - one must give one lamb to a priest; If these two donkeys give birth to two females and a male, or two males and two females - the priest gets nothing.",

[If it gave birth to] a male and a female, he sets apart one lamb for himself. A firstborn donkey is redeemed with a lamb, [whether the lamb or kid is] from sheep or goats, male or female, large or small, perfect or blemished - one may redeem with it, and one can use it to redeem many times; and if it dies, one can benefit from it.",
            "One may not redeem with a calf, nor with an undomesticated animal, nor  with a slaughtered animal, nor with a <i>treifa</i> [animal which clearly will not live another 12 months], or with a mixed species [i.e., from sheep and goat parents], nor with a <i>koy</i> [a species whose domestic/feral status is uncertain]. Rabbi Elazar permits with a mixed species because it is still [considered] a lamb; But he forbids a <i>koy</i>, because it is of doubtful [status]. If one gives a donkey to a priest - the priest does not have permission to keep it, until he separates a lamb for it.",
            "One who separates the redemption for a firstborn donkey, and it dies-- Rabbi Eliezer says, he is liable for it, just like the five <i>selas</i> [coins of a specific value] for [the redemption of] a son; The Sages say, he is not liable for it, just like the redemption of <i>Maasar Sheini</i> [second tithe, which is consumed in Jerusalem]. Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Tzadok testified regarding the redemption of a firstborn donkey that died, that that priest receives nothing in such a case. If a firstborn donkey dies - Rabbi Eliezer says: it is buried and it is permissible to benefit from the lamb; The Sages say: He need not bury it, and the lamb goes to the priest",
            "If one does not want to redeem it, he breaks its neck from behind with an ax, and buries it. The mitzvah of redeeming it precedes the mitzvah of breaking its neck, as it is written \"If you will not redeem it, break its neck\"; (Shemot 13:13; 34:20) The mitzvah of designating it precedes the mitzvah of redeeming it, as it is written \"that you have not designated it -it shall be redeemed\"; (Shemot 21:8). The mitzvah of Levirate marriage precedes the mitzvah of <i>chalitza</i> [ceremony releasing the widow of a childless man from the obligation to marry his brother] - at first, when they had intention for the sake of the mitzvah, but now that they do not have intention for the sake of the mitzvah, we say that the mitzvah of <i>chalitza</i> precedes the mitzvah of Levirate marriage. The mitzvah of redeeming [an animal devoted to general Temple usage] is on the master before any other person, as it is written \"If it is not redeemed, it shall be sold for its estimated worth:' (Vayikra 27:27) "

If he was an expert of the court he is exempt from paying.  It once happened with a cow whose womb was taken out and Rabbi Tarfon through it to the dogs and it came before the sages and they permitted it.  Todos the doctor said, no cow leaves Alexandria until they cut out its womb so it cannot give birth.  Rabbi Tarfon says your donkey has left you Tarfon.

One who miscarries a fetus full of blood, water, or worms, or if she miscarried the form of a fish, locust, insect or creepy thing, or one who miscarries [before] the fortieth day, the one that comes after them is a firstborn for the portion and the priest. ",
            "One born through Cesarean section and the one that comes after him are not a firstborn for the portion or the priest.  Rabbi Shimon says, the first one is for the portion and the second is for the five selas [given to the priest]. ",
            "One whose wife had never given birth and she gave birth to two boys he gives five selas to the priest.  If one of them died within thirty days the father is exempt.  If the father died and the children are still alive Rabbi Meir says if they gave [the 5 selas] before they divided the estate it is given, but if not they are exempt.  Rabbi Yehuda says, the estate was made obligated.  If she gave birth to a boy and a girl the priest gets nothing.  ",
            "Two women who have not given birth and they gave birth to two boys, he gives ten selas to the priest.  If one of the children dies within thirty days, if he gave [all ten] to one priest he returns five to him.  If he gave them to two priests he cannot retrieve form either of them.  If they gave birth to a boy and a girl or two boys and a girl he gives five selas to the priest.  Two girls and a boy or two boys and two girls, the priest receives nothing.  If one woman had given birth and the other had not and they give birth to two boys, he gives five selas to the priest.  If one of them dies within thirty days the priest is exempt.  If the father dies and the children are still alive, Rabbi Meir says if they gave [the five selas] before the estate was divided it is given but if not they are exempt.  Rabbi Yehuda says, the estate has become liable.  If they gave birth to a boy and a girl the priest receives nothing.  ",
            "Two wives of two men who had not given birth and they gave birth to two boys [who became mixed up], this one gives five selas to a priest and this one gives five selas to a priest.  If one of them dies within thirty days, if they gave it to one priest he gives them back five selas.  If they gave their money to two priests, they cannot extract money from either.  A boy and a girl, the fathers are exempt and the boy must redeem himself.  If they gave birth to two girls and a boy or two boys and two girls, the priest receives nothing. ",
            "If one woman had given birth and the other had not, of two men and they gave birth to two boys [who became mixed up] the one whose wife had not given birth gives five selas to a priest.  If they gave birth to a boy and a girl the priest receives nothing.  If the boy dies within thirty days, even if he already gave [the money] to the priest he returns to him [the 5 selas].  After thirty days [if he dies] even if he hasn't given yet he should give. If he dies on the thirtieth day it is like the day before.  Rabbi Akiva says if he gave already he cannot take it back, but if he hasn't given yet he does not have to give.  If the father died within thirty days it is assumed he did not redeem him until he brings proof that he was already redeemed.  After thirty days, it is assumed he did redeem him until he brings proof that he didnt.  If he has to redeem himself and his son he comes before his son.  Rabbi Yehuda says his son comes first because his obligation is on the father and the sons obligation is on him.",
            "The five selas of his son, are in the Tzurian maneh, the thirty of the slave, the fifty of the raper and seducer or the hundred of the slanderer are all in the Shekel of the temple in the Tzurian Maneh.  And they are all redeemed with money or with something that has monetary value, except for Shekels. ",
            "They do not redeem with slaves or documents or property or sanctified others.  If he wrote to a priest that he owes him five selas, he must give them to him but his son is not redeemed, therefore if the priest wants to return [the money] to him as a gift he is permitted.  If one set aside money for the redemption of his son and it was lost he is obligated to replacement as it says (Numbers 18) \"It can be yours\" and \"You shall surely redeem\".",
            "The first born takes a double portion in the property of his father but does not take a double portion of the mother's property.  And he does not take a double portion in the value it increases [after his death] and not in what is supposed to come to him as what he holds now.  Neither does a woman for her Ketubah, nor daughters for their sustenance, and not the yavam, none of them receive a portion of the increased value or of what is supposed to come like what is already held.   ",
            "The following do not come get returned on the Yovel, the first born portion, one who inherit's his wife, or who performs Yibbum with his brother's wife, or a gift says Rabbi Meir.  The sages say a gift is like a sale.  Rabbi Eliezer says, all of these things are returned on the Yovel.  Rabbi Yochanan ben Beroka says one who inherits his wife should return it to her family and he may deduct from the money [the cost of his obligations to his wife after her death]. "

            "The animal tithe applies both in Israel and outside Israel, both when the temple stands and when the temple does not exist, for non-sacred animals but not for sacred animals.  And it applies to cattle and sheep, but they cannot be tithed one for the other.  Sheep and goats may be tithed one for the other.  It applies to both new and old animals but they are not tithed one for the other.  Because we could have said, just as old and new animals which do not make a mixed breed are not tithed one for the other, so too sheep an goats which do create a mixed breed, should they certainly not be tithed one for the other, therefore it says (Leviticus 27) \"and sheep\" which means all types of sheep are one. ",
            "Tithed animals join together as long as they are within the distance that cattle pasture.   \nAnd what is the distance over which they pasture? Sixteen mils.   \nIf there was between this group and this group thirty-two mils, they do not combine. \nIf however there was one in the middle he brings them into the middle and tithes them.   \nRabbi Meir says: the [river] Jordan is divides for matters of tithing animals.\n",
            "That which was bought or given to him as a gift is exempt from the animal tithe.  Brothers who are are partners and are obligated in the Kalbon are exempt from the animal tithe and those who are obligated in the animal tithe are exempt from the Kalbon.  If they bought it with what they inherited they are obligated but if not they are exempt.  If they divided them and then rejoined them they are obligated in the Kalbon but exempt from the animal tithe. ",
            "All enter the pen to be tithed except mixed kinds, a terefah, offspring from a caesarean section, an animal too young for sacrifice, and an “orphan”. \nAnd what is an “orphan”? When its mother has died during its birth or was slaughtered [and subsequently gave birth.] \nRabbi Joshua says: even if the mother has been slaughtered, if the hide is still intact the offspring is not an \"orphan.\"\n",
            "There are three threshing floors for animal tithes: in the peras of Pesah, in the peras of Atzeret (Shavuot) and in the peras of the Feast [of Sukkot], the words of Rabbi Akiva. \nBen Azzai says: on the twenty-ninth of Adar, on the first of Sivan and on the twenty-ninth of Av. \nRabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: on the first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan and on the twenty-ninth of Elul. \nAnd why did they say the twenty-ninth of Elul and not the first of Tishrei?   \nBecause it is a holy day and you cannot tithe on a holy day. Consequently they moved it up to the twenty-ninth of Elul. \nRabbi Meir says: the first of Elul is the New Year for the animal tithe.   \nBen Azzai says: those born in Elul are tithed by themselves. ",
            "All animals born from the first of Tishrei till the 29th of Elul can be combined.  Five from before Rosh Hashanah and five from after Rosh Hashanah cannot be combined.  Five before a threshing floor [cutoff period] and five after the threshing floor can combine.  If so why did they say there are three threshing floors for the animal tithe?  Because until the threshing floor has come one can sell and slaughter, once it has arrived he cannot slaughter it but if he did, he is exempt.",
            "How does one tithe animals? \nHe brings them to a pen and makes for them a small opening so that two cannot go out at the same time. \nAnd he counts them with a rod: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. \nAnd the one that comes out tenth he marks with red chalk and he says: “Behold, this is the tithe.” \nIf he did not mark it, or if he did not count them with a rod, or if he counted them while they were crouching or standing, they are still considered tithed. \nIf he had one hundred [lambs] and he took ten or if he had ten and he took one [without counting], this is not [a valid] tithe.   \nRabbi Yose bar Judah says: this is a [valid] tithe. \nIf one the already counted ones jumped back into the flock they are all exempt.   \nIf one of the tithes [jumped back] into the flock, they all go to pasture until they become blemished, and the owners may eat them in their blemished state. \n",
            "If two came out at the same time, he counts them two at a time.   \nIf he counted [the two] as one, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled.   \nIf the ninth and the tenth came out at the same time, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled.   \nIf he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the ninth and the eleventh the tenth, all three are holy: the ninth can be eaten when it becomes blemished, the tenth is the tithe and the eleventh is sacrificed as a well being offering, and it can make a substitute, the words of Rabbi Meir. \nRabbi Judah said: can one substitute make another substitute?   \nThey said in the name of Rabbi Meir: if it were a substitute, it would not have been sacrificed.   \nIf he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the tenth and the eleventh the tenth, the eleventh is not holy.   \nThe following is the general rule: wherever the name of the tenth [animal] has not been taken away from it, the eleventh is not holy. \n"
