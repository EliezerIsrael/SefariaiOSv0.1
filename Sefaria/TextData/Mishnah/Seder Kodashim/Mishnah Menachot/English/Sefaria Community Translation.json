But Passover offerings are only brought from sheep or goats, so why does it say \"Sheep or cattle\"? Rather it is to connect everything that comes from cattle or sheep to the Passover offering:  Just as the Passover offering which comes as an obligation can only be brought from non-sacred money so too anything which comes as an obligation can only be brought from non-sacred money.  Therefore one who says, \"I accept upon myself a todah or a shlamim\", since they are brought as an obligation, they are only brought from non-sacred money.
