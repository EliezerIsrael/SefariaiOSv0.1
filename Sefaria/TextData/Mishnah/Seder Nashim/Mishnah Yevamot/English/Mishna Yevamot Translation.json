            "A man may not abstain from \"be fruitful and multiply,\" unless he has children.  Beit Shammai say, Two males.  Beit Hillel say, A male and a female, as it is written, \"Male and female He created them\" (Gen. 5:2).  If he married a woman, and stayed with her ten years, and she did not bear children - he may not abstain.  If he divorced her - she is permitted to marry another.  And the second may stay with her ten years.  And if she miscarried, he counts from the time that she miscarried.  Man is commanded to be \"fruitful and multiply,\" but not woman.  Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says, Regarding both it states, \"And God blessed them, and God said to them: 'Be fruitful and multiply'\" (Gen. 1:28)."
