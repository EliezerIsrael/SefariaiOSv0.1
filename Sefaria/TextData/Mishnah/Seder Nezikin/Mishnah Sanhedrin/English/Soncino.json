            "ALL ISRAEL  HAVE A PORTION IN THE WORLD TO COME,  FOR IT IS WRITTEN, THY PEOPLE ARE ALL RIGHTEOUS; THEY SHALL INHERIT THE LAND FOR EVER, THE BRANCH OF MY PLANTING, THE WORK OF MY HANDS, THAT I MAY BE GLORIFIED. BUT THE FOLLOWING HAVE NO PORTION THEREIN: HE WHO MAINTAINS THAT RESURRECTION IS NOT A BIBLICAL DOCTRINE, THE TORAH WAS NOT DIVINELY REVEALED, AND AN EPIKOROS. R. AKIVA ADDED: ONE WHO READS UNCANONICAL BOOKS.  ALSO ONE WHO WHISPERS [A CHARM] OVER A WOUND AND SAYS, I WILL BRING NONE OF THESE DISEASES UPON THEE WHICH I BROUGHT UPON THE EGYPTIANS FOR I AM THE LORD THAT HEALETH THEE.  ABBA SHAUL SAYS: ALSO ONE WHO PRONOUNCES THE DIVINE NAME AS IT IS SPELT.",
            "Three kings and four commoners have no share in the world to come.  The three kings are:  Yerovam, Achav, and Menashe.  Rabbi Judah says:  Menashe does have a share in the world to come, as it says (II Chronicles 33), \"[Menashe] prayed to [God] and God was moved by him and listened to his plea and returned him to Jerusalem to his kingdom.\"  They said to him:  To his kingdom he was returned, but to the world to come he was not returned.  The four commoners are:  Bilam, Doeg, Ahitofel, and Gehazi.",
