            "Both cases of money (non-capital) and cases of life (capital) have examination and inquiry, as it is written (Leviticus 24:22) \"You shall have one justice.\" What is the difference between cases of money and cases of life: Cases of money [are tried] with three [judges], and cases of life, with twenty-three. Cases of money are opened either [with arguments] to acquit or to convict, and cases of life open [with arguments] to acquit but do not open [with arguments] to convict. Cases of money are decided by one either to acquit or to convict; cases of life are decided by one to acquit or by two to convict. Cases of money, [the verdict] can change between acquittal and conviction; cases of life can change to acquittal but cannot change to conviction. Cases of money, all can rule for acquittal or conviction; cases of life, all can rule for acquittal but all cannot rule for conviction. Cases of money, one who convicts can acquit and one who acquits can convict; in cases of life, one who convicts can acquit, but one who acquits cannot turn and convict. Cases of money can be tried in the day and can finish in the night; cases of life are tried in the day and must finish in the day. Cases of money finish on the same day for either acquittal or conviction; cases of life finish on the same day for acquittal and the next day for conviction, therefore there cannot be trials on Friday evening or the evening before a holiday.",
            "Cases of impurity and purity begin from the greatest [judge], cases of life begin from [the judges on] the side. All are acceptable to judge in cases of money, but none are acceptable to judge in cases of life except for priests, Levites, and Israelites whose daughters can marry priests.",
            "The Sanhedrin was (organized like) half of a round granary, so that each (judge) could see each (judge). Two court scribes stood before them, one on the right and one on the left, and they wrote the words of the acquitting [defense] and the words of the convicting [prosecution]. Rabbi Yehuda says, (there were) three, one wrote the words of the acquitting and one wrote the words of the convicting, and the third wrote the words of the acquitting and the words of the convicting.",
            "And three rows of students sit before them, each one knows his (proper) place. (When) there was a need to appoint (a new judge), they appointed from the first (row). One from the second (row) comes to the first, and one from the third (row) comes to the second, and they choose for them one more (student) from the community who is seated in the third (row). He didn't sit in the place of the first (student), but rather he sits in the place seen for him. [Another explanation of the verse: for his blood was splattered over the trees and rocks (i.e. there was more than one pool of blood).] (The judges' speech continues:) \"It was for this reason that man was first created as one person (viz. Adam), to teach you that anyone who destroys a life (some editions: from Israel) is considered by Scripture to have destroyed an entire world; any any who saves a life (some editions: from Israel) is as if he saved an entire world.\" [And also, to promote peace among the creations, that no man would say to his friend, \"My ancestors are greater than yours.\" And also, so that heretics will not say, \"there are many rulers up in Heaven.\" And also, to express the grandeur of The Holy One [blessed be He]: For a man strikes many coins from the same die, and all the coins are alike. But the King, the King of Kings, The Holy One [blessed be He] strikes every man from the die of the First Man, and yet no man is quite like his friend.]"

            "Once the verdict is reached, they bring him [the accused] out to stone him. The stoning area was outside the courthouse, as it is written (Leviticus 24) \"bring out the cursor.\" One person would stand before the entrance to the courthouse and the cloths would be in his hand and another person would ride on a horse before them at a distance so that he would see him. If someone  says 'I have a way to argue your innocence,' then he waves the cloths and the horse comes and supports him. And even if the accused says 'I have a way to argue my own innocence,' then he is returned, and this may happen even four or five times, so long as there is substance to his words. If he is found innocent, then he is exempt, and if not he is brought out to be stoned. And an announce comes out before him and announces, 'So-and-so, son of so-and-so is being brought out to be stoned for having committed such-and-such transgression, and so-and-so and so-and-so are his witnesses. Anyone who has any knowledge as to his innocence should come and argue for him.",
            "Once he [the accused] is ten cubit from the stoning area they say to him, 'confess,' for such is the way of those sentenced to death to confess, for al who confess have a share in the world to come. This is what we have found  by Achan, to whom Joshuah said (Joshuah 7) \"Son, give honor, please, to Gd, the Lord of Israel and give him a confession...and Achan  answered Joshuah and said, 'I have sinned to Gd the Lord of Israel...\" And from where do we know that his confession atoned for him? As it is written (there), \"And Joshuah said '",
            "Once he is four cubits from the stoning area his clothes are removed. If it is a man, his front is covered. If it is a woman, her front and her back are covered, this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. And the Sages say, both men and women are stoned naked.",
            "The stoning area was two stories high.  One of the witnesses pushes him on his waist.  If he rolls on his chest, they roll him to his back.  If he dies from this, it is fulfilled.  If not, the second (witness) picks up the rock and puts it on his chest.  If he dies from this, it is fulfilled.  If not, his stoning is by all of Israel as it says (Deuteronomy 17), \"The hand of the witnesses will be against him first to kill him and the hand of the rest of the nation following.\"  All who are stoned are hung, the words of Rabbi Eliezer.  The sages say, none are hung except the one who curses God's name and the idolitor.  They hang a man facing the people and a woman facing the wood, the words of Rabbi Eliezer.  The sages say, a man is hung but a woman is not hung.  Rabbi Eliezer said to them:  Didn't Shimon ben Shetach hang women in Ashkelon?  They said to him:  he hung eighty women and we don't even judge two in one day!  How do they hang him?  They lie the beam on the ground and the wood goes up from it.  And they tie his hands together and hang him.  Rabbi Yose says:  the beam leans on a wall and they hang him the way that butchers do.  And then they free him immediately.  If he stays there overnight, he violates a negative commandment.  As it says (Deuteronomy 21), \"Do not leave his body on the wood but rather you must surely bury him on that same day, for a hung (body) is a curse of God.\"  Which is to say:  why was he hung?  Because he cursed God.  But God's name ends up cursed anyway.",
            "Said Rabbi Meir: When a human being suffers, what does Gd say? 'I am in pain from my head, I am in pain from my arms.' If so then Gd feel distress over the blood of evil-doers that is spilled, how much the more so over the blood of righteous people. And furthermore, anyone who leaves a dead body out overnight [instead of burying it immediately] transgresses a negative commandment. But if one leave a body overnight without burying it for the sake of its honor, to bring it a coffin and a shroud, he does not transgress it. And such a body [of a convict] would not be buried in the grave of his fathers, rather two gravesites would be made before the courthouse, one for those punished by killing and stragulation, and one for those punished by stoning and burning.",
            "When the flesh decomposes, the bones are collected and buried in their proper place.  And the relatives would come and greet the judges and the witnesses, as if to say, we hold nothing against you, and we know that you ruled with true justice.  And they do not mourn publicly but they do have aspects of mourning, since that kind of mourning is in the heart."

            "Four forms of corporal punishment were passed on to the courts: stoning, burning, killing [by sword], and strangulation. Rabbi Shimon said, burning, stoning, strangulation, and killing. The following is the law of those being stoned.",
            "The process of those who are burned:  They would bury him in manure up to his knees and fold a hard scarf inside a soft one and tie it around his neck.  One would pull one end and one would pull the other end until he opened his mouth.  Then they would light a wick and throw it into his mouth and it went down into his bowels and hardens his bowels.  Rabbi Judah says: if he died this way, they would not have fulfilled the commandment to burn.  Rather, they open his mouth with pliers which are not pleasant and light the wick and throw it into his mouth and it goes down into his bowels and hardens his bowels.  Rabbi Eliezer ben Zadok:  Once a priest's daughter who became a harlot, they surrounded her with grapevine rope and burned her.  They said to him:  that was because the court at that time was not expert.",
            "The process of killing: they would chop off his head with a sword as the government does.  Rabbi Judah says: that is horrible!  Rather, they rest his head on a stump and cut it with a butcher's knife.  They said to him: there is no death more horrible than that!  The process of strangulation:  they would bury him in manure up to his knees and wrap a rough scarf in a soft one and tie it around his neck.  One would pull from one side and the other would pull from the other side until his soul departed.",
            "These are those who are stoned [to death as capital punishment]: [a male] who sleeps with his mother, with the wife of his father, with his daughter-in-law, with a male, a woman who causes an animal to sleep with her, one who blasphemes [God's name], one who worships foreign worship [other gods], one who gives of his children to Molech, one who practices Ov and Yidoni, one who desecrates the Sabbath, one who curses his father and mother, one who sleeps with a betrothed girl, a convince-er, a sway-er [those who convince and sway a person to worship idols], one who performs magic, and a wayward son. One who sleeps with his mother is liable for [sleeping with his] mother and for his father's wife. Rabbi Yehuda says: he is only liable for [sleeping with his] mother. One who sleeps with his father's wife is liable for [sleeping with] his father's wife and for a married woman, whether in his father's lifetime or after his father's death, whether [she is his father's wife] through betrothal or through completed marriage. One who sleeps with his daugther-in-law is liable for [sleeping with] his daughter-in-law and for a married woman, whether in his sons's lifetime or after his son's death, whether [she is his son's wife] through betrothal or through completed marriage. One who sleeps with a male, or an animal, or a woman who causes an animal to sleep with her - if a person sinned, what has the animal sinned? Rather, since a person was brought to fall by its hand [i.e. because of it], therefore the text said it [the animal] should be stoned. Another thing [reason], so that the animal should not be passing through the market-place and they will say, \"this is the one which so-and-so was stoned because of it.\"",
            "One who curses [God] is not liable until he [explicitly] utter utters the name [of God]. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah said: every day the witnesses are [judged] with the kinui of \"Yossi should hit Yossi\". Once the judgement has been passed down, [the courts] don't kill [the defendant, based upon the testimony  of the witnesses through] kinui, rather, they take everyone outside, and ask the greatest one [witness] among them, and tell him: \"say what you heard explicitly\", and he says [the full curse], and the judges stand upon their feet, and tear [their clothes] and don't {}. And the second [witness] says also me [I heard] like him. And the third [witness] says also me [I heard] like him.",
            "One who worships foreign worship - whether worshiping, offering offerings, bringing incense, pouring libations, bowing, accepting it as a god, or one who says to it, \"You are my god.\" But one who hugs, kisses, honors, kneels before, washes, anoints, dresses, or puts its shoes on, [only] transgresses a \"don't do\" [negative commandment]. One who takes a vow in its name or upholds in its name transgresses a \"don't do\" [negative commandment]. One who is \"po'er\" to Pe'or [defecates on the idol named Pe'or], this is its worship. One who throws a stone to Markolis, this is its worship.",
            "In the case of one who sacrifices of his children to Molech- he only becomes guilty when he gives over the child to Molech and passes it through the fire.  In the case of he who passes the child through fire but does not give over the child or he who gives over the child but does not pass him through fire, the man is not guilty until he gives over the child and passes him through fire.  A \"Ba'al Ov\" (master of ancestral spirits) is one who vivifies the dead to speak and speaks through them. A \"Yidoni\" (seer) is one who speaks through his own mouth.  The Ba'al Ov and Yidoni are killed by stoning, and the one who consults them is, with a warning, guilty of transgression.",
            "One who desecrates Shabbat, if the act was done intentionally, he is liable to be cut off, and if his act was unintentional , he is liable to a sin offering. One who curses his mother and father, he is not liable, unless he curses them by name. If he curses them using a nickname, Rabbi Meir says he is liable, and the Sages exempt him.",
            "One who comes upon a betrothed na'arah , he is not obligated (to stoning) until she is a na'arah, virgin, betrothed and in her father's household. If two come upon her (in an unusual manner), the first is obligated to stoning, and the second  is obligated to choking.",

If he says to two and they are his witnesses, we bring him to court and stone him. If he says to one, one responds, \"I have friends who want this.\" If the inciter is crafty and is not able to speak before them, they set up a trap behind the fence, and he says to the inciter, \"Say to me what you said to me in seclusion.\" The inciter says it to him. He responds, \"How can we set aside our G-D in Heaven and go and serve wood and stones!\" If he retracts, good. If he responds, \"This is our obligation and this is good for us,\" those standing behind the fence bring him to court and stone him.

            "These are those that are strangled: one who strikes his mother or father, one who kidnaps a Jew, an elder who is rebellious according to a Beit Din [court], a false prophet, one who prophesies in the name of idolatry, an adulterer, one who schemes against a priest's daughter and sleeps with her. One who strikes his mother or father is not liable unless he wounds them. Thus it is more stringent regarding cursing than regarding striking, as one who curses after death is liable, while one who strikes after death is exempt. One who kidnaps a Jew is not liable until they enter his domain. Rabbi Yehuda said: until they enter his domain and he puts him to work [as a slave], as it says: \"and he dealt with him as a slave and sold him\" (Deuteronomy 24:7). One who steals his son, [Rabbi Yishmael the son of] Rabbi Yohanan the son of Beroka finds him liable, and the Sages exempt him. One who steals someone who is a half-slave, half-free, Rabbi Yehuda finds him liable, and the Sages exempt him.",
            "An elder rebellious against the words of the Beis Din, as it is written (Devarim 17:8) \"If there is something bewildering to you in judgement...\" There were three courts there, one sits at the entrance of the Temple Mount, one sits at the entrance of the Courtyard, and one sits at the Gazis Chamber. They come to this one at the entrance of the Temple Mount, and they say, so I have explained and so have my fellows explained, so I have learned and so have my fellows learned. If they heard, they tell him. If not, they come to those that are at the entrance of the Courtyard, and they say, so I have explained and so have my fellows explained, so I have learned and so have my fellows learned. If they heard, they tell him. If not, they come to those that are at the Gazis Chamber, that from there comes out Torah to all of Israel, as it is written, \"From that place which Hashem has chosen.\" If he returns to his city and repeats and teached the way he learned, then he is exempt. And if he instructed to do so, he is liable, as it is written, \"And the man that does so purposefully, he is not liable until he instructs to do so\". If a student instructs to do so, he is exempt, it results that his stringency is his leniency.",
            "The words of the Sages are more stringent that the words of Torah. One that says there is no such thing as Tefillin, in order to transgress the words of the Torah, he is exempt. But to say that there are five compartments, to add to the words of the Sages, he is liable. ",
            "They do not put him to death in the Beis Din in his city or in the Beis Din in Yavneh, but rather they bring him up to the Great Beis Din in Jerusalem, and they guard him until the festival and put him to death on the festival, as it is written, (Devarim 17:13) \"And all the nation shall hear and see and they will no longer sin,\" these are the words of Rebbe Akiva. Rebbe Yehuda says, they do not delay the judgement of this one, rather they kill him immediately, and they write and send messengers in every place, this man son of that man was liable to death by Beis Din. ",
            "A false prophet that prophecies on what he did not hear and what was not said to him, his death is by man. But a person that hides his prophecy, and one who disregards the word of a prophet, and a prophet that transgresses his own words, his death is by heaven, as it is written \"Devarim 18:19) \"I will require it from him\".",
            "One who prophesies in the name of idolatry and says, so says the idolatry, even if followed the law to make the impure impure and the pure pure. One that comes upon a married woman, since she has entered the domain of her husband for nisuin, even though he has not consummated her, the one who has come upon shall be put to death by strangulation. False witnesses of a daughter of a Kohen and a man that has relations with her, that all false witnesses receive the same type of death penalty, except for false witnesses of a daughter of a Kohen and a man that has relations with her."
