            "How are conspiring witnesses dealt with?  [If they said] \"We testify that so-and-so is the son of a divorced woman\" or \"the son of a chalutzah,\" we do not say that he should become the son of a divorced woman or the son of a chalutzah in place of the accused.  Rather, he is given 40 lashes.  [If they said] \"We testify that so-and-so is to be exiled,\" we do not say \"exile this witness in his place.\"  Rather, he is given 40 lashes.  [If they said] \"We testify that so-and-so divorced his wife and did not give her [the money promised to her in her] Ketubah,\"   eventually the accused would have given her the [money promised to her in her] Ketubah [and thus there is no permanent condition for the witness to be given in place of the accused].  Therefore, we assess how much someone would pay for this woman's Kesubah on condition that if her husband dies or they get divorced he would recieve the money, but if she then dies [before her husband], the husband would inherit her property [including the Ketuubah].  [If they said] \"We testify that so-and-so owes his friend 1,000 Zuz to be repaid within 30 days,\" and the accused [admits that he owes the money but] says he must pay back his dept within 10 years, we asses the difference between how much a person would be willing to pay to borrow 1,000 zuz for 10 years     and how much he would pay to borrow the money for only 30 days.",
            "Witnesses who testify that Plony owes his friend 200 zuz and is found to have lied, he receives lashes and pays, for it is not the same cause that brings upon them lashes that brings upon them payment. This is according to Rabbi Meir. And the sages say, anyone who pays does not receive lashes.",
            "\"We testify against this man Ploni that he deserves 40 lashes\", and they were found to be zommemim (scheming), they receive 80 lashes, because of \"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,\" (Exodus 20:12),  and because of \"Then shall you do unto him, as he had purposed to do,\" (Deuteronomy 19:19), these are the words of Rabbi meir. And the sages say they do not receive but 40 lashes. You triple in money but do not triple in lashes. How? If they testified that he owed his friend 200 zuz, and they were found to be zommemim (scheming), between them they have to pay triple that amount. But if they testified that he deserved 40 lashes, and they were found to be zommemim (scheming), each one of them receives 40 lashes.",
            "Witnesses are not considered \"plotting witnesses\" until they have contradicted themselves. How does this occur? They said, \"We testify that the person Ploni (anonymous) killed someone.\" Another pair of witnesses reply, \"How are you testifying about this person Ploni, because (either) Ploni was with us, (or) the person who was supposedly killed by Ploni was with us, at the same time in a specific place.\" The first pair of witnesses would not be considered to be \"plotting witnesses\". But, if the second pair of witnesses had come and said, \"You (the first pair of witnesses) were with us at that same time in a different specific place, then the first pair of witnesses would be considered \"plotting witnesses\", and they would receive capital punishment.",
            "If others come and prove perjury, and others come and prove their purjery, even 100 [times], all of them are put to death. Rabbi Yehuda says, \"This is seditious. The only group that is put to death is the first one alone.\"",
            "Plotting witnesses are not killed until the judgement is finished, and the Saduccees say not until the defendant is killed, because the verse says (Leviticus 24:18, Exodus 21:23): \"a life for a life\". The Sages said to the Saduccess, but didn't it already say (Deuteronomy 19:19): \"You shall do to him like he plotted to do to his brother\" and clearly his brother is still alive. So then why does it say \"a life for a life\"? You might think that they can be killed from the time their testimony is accepted, but the verse comes to teach us \"A life for a life\", they are not killed until the judgement is finished.",
            "(Deuteronomy 17:6) \"By the testimony of two or three witnesses [the perpetrator] shall surely be put to death.\" If two witnesses establish testimony, why did the verse specify three witnesses?  The Torah is relating three witnesses to two witnesses.  Just as a group of three witnesses can make a group of two witnesses zomemin, so too a group of two witnesses can make a group of three witnesses zomemin.  And where do we know that a group of two witnesses can make a group of one hundred witnesses zomemin?  The Torah says \"witnesses\".  Rabbi Shim'on says: Just as two witnesses are not killed until both of them become zomemin so too three witnesses are not killed until all three of them are zomemin.  And where do we know that this is the case even for one hundred witnesses?  The Torah says: \"witnesses\".  Rabbi 'Akiva says: The third witness in the group only makes the case stricter and makes his punishment like that of the others.  If so, the Torah punishes those that assist transgressors like transgressors.  All the more so, those who assist in the performance of mitzvoth will be rewarded like those that perform mitzvoth.",
            "Just as if there were two [witnesses], and one was found to be a close relative or invalid, the entire testimony is invalidated, so too if there are three [witnesses] and one was found to be a close relative or invalid the entire testimony is invalidated. From where do we know [that this applies] even for one hundred [witnesses]?  The verse states: \"witnesses\". Rabbi Yossi said: \"What case are we talking about?  In cases of capital cases, however with monetary cases the testimony is upheld by the others.\" Rebbe said: \"The law is the same for capital cases and monetary cases.\"  And when is this?  In a case when they gave warning to [the perpetrator], however when they did not give warning what can two brothers do who saw someone killing a person?",
            "Should two [witnesses] see [the perpetrator] from one window and two [witnesses] see him from another window and one [witness] warns him, if they have a partial view of each other they are considered as one group.  If not, they are considered as two groups.  Therefore if one pair is found guilty of perjury  [in a capital crime], both they and the  accused will be executed, and the other pair is exempt.  Rabbi Yossi says: \"They are never executed unless warned by two witnesses as it says (Deuteronomy 17:6): 'By the mouth of two witnesses.'\" Alternatively: \"By the mouth of two witnesses,\" [meaning] the court should not hear testimony in translation. ",
            "If someone whose judgement was final, ran away but came back to the same Beit Din, we do not rip up his old judgment. Any place or time that two witnesses came and said, \"We testify that this person that had a judgement passed against him in a certain court,\" and \"Joe\" and \"Jon\" were the witnesses, we kill [the defendant on this testimony]. A Sanhedrin that would execute somebody once every seven years would be considered a violent Beit Din. Rabbi Elazar Ben Azariah says: \"Once every 70 years.\" Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi 'Akiva said: \"If we were on the Sanhedrin we would never have killed anyone!\" Rabban Shim'on Ben Gamliel said: \"They would have increased violence in Israel.\""

            "These are exiled:  one who kills a human accidentally.  If he was rolling a roller and it fell on him and killed him, or if he was raising a barrel and it fell and killed him, or if he was descending a ladder and fell and killed him-- all of these would be exiled.  However, if he was pulling a roller and it fell and killed him, or if he was lowering a barrel and the rope broke and it fell and killed him, or if he was climbing a ladder and fell and killed him-- such a person is not exiled.  This is the principle:  anything that is on its way down, exile.  Anything that is not on its way down, no exile.  If the blade came off the handle and killed, Rabbi says he is not exiled but the sages say he is exiled.  If it came out of the wood being chopped, Rabbi says he is exiled but the sages say he is not exiled.",
            "One who throws a rock into a public space and it kills someone, he is exiled.  Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:  if the person stuck his head into the public space only after the stone left his hand, he is exempt.  If he threw the stone into his courtyard and it killed:  if the victim had permission to be there, he is exiled, but if he did not have permission, he is not exiled, as it says (Deuteronomy 19:5), \"If he comes upon his fellow in the woods...\" Just as the woods is open for both the victim and the perpetrator to be there, which excludes an owned courtyard where it is not the case that both the victim and the perpetrator have permission to be there.  Aba Shaul says: Just as chopping wood is optional, [so too one is only exiled for optional activities] which excludes a father beating his son, a teacher disciplining his student, and the messenger of the courts.",
            "A father can be exiled on account of (killing his) son and a son can be exiled on account of (killing his) father.  All are exiled on account of (killing) an Israelite and an Israelite is exiled on account of (killing) them, except for a resident alien.  A resident alien is only exiled on account of (killing) a resident alien.  A blind person is not exiled, the words of Rabbi Judah.  Rabbi Meir says (a blind person is) exiled.  A known enemy is not exiled.  Rabbi Yose bar Yehuda says:  a known enemy is killed because he is as one who is habitual.  Rabbi Shimon says:  some known enemies are exiled and some are not exiled.  This is the general rule:  anyone who we can say killed with intent is not exiled.  If he killed without intent, he is exiled.",
            "To where are they exiled?  To the cities of refuge:  3 on the other side of the Jordan River and 3 in the land of Canaan, as it says, (Numbers 35:14) \"Give three cities on this side of the Jordan and give three cities in the land of Canaan.\"  Until the three were chosen in the land of Canaan, the three on the other side of the Jordan did not collect, as it says, (Numbers 35:15) \"These six cities\"-- until all six can collect as one.",
            "And roads are designated from one to the next, as it says, (Deuteronomy 19:3), \"Prepare the road and divide in thirds...\" Two sages are given to them lest they kill him on the road and they speak with him.  Rabbi Meir says:  He speaks for himself, as it says, (Deuteronomy 19:4), \"And this is the matter/word of the murderer...\"",
            "Rabbi Yose bar Yehuda says:  At the outset, both neglectful and purposeful arrive at the city of refuge.  The court sends and takes him from there.  One who is to be killed by the court, they kill him.  One who is to be exiled, they return him to his place, as it says (Numbers 35:25), \"The community will return him to his city of refuge.\"  (The death of) one who is anointed with oil (the high priest) and one who has many clothes (a step in becoming the high priest) and one who used to be anointed, those return the killer (from the city of refuge to his city of origin).  Rabbi Judah says: even one who is anointed for the purposes of war returns the killer.  Therefore, the mothers of priests provided food and clothes (to the residents of cities of refuge), so they would not pray for their sons to die.  If the high priest died after his judgment was finished, he is not exiled.  If the high priest died before his judgment was finished and they appointed a new one and after that his judgment was finished, he is returned with the death of the second.",
            "If his judgment is finished without a high priest, or if he kills the high priest, or a high priest who kills, those never leave there (the city of refuge).  And he may not leave in order to testify for an obligatory purpose or for a monetary case or for a capital case.  Even if Israel needs him, even if the head of the military of Israel like Yoav ben Zeruiah, he may not ever leave there.  As it says (Numbers 35:25), \"Where he ran there\"-- there must be his residence, there must be his death, there must be his burial.  Just as the city collects (protects), so too its outskirts collect.  A killer who leaves the outskirts and the blood avenger (next of kin) finds him, Rabbi Yose the Galilean says:  (killing him) is an obligation of the blood avenger and optional for anyone.  Rabbi Akiva says:  (killing him) is optional for the blood avenger and any person is not liable for it.  A tree which stands in the outskirts and its shade stretches out of the outskirts or if the tree stands out of the outskirts and its shade stretches into the outskirts, the ruling is according to the shade.  If he kills in the same city, he is exiled from one neighborhood to another neighborhood.  A Levite who kills is exiled from one city to another.",
            "Similarly, a killer who was exiled to his city of refuge and the people of that city want to honor him, he should say to them, \"I am a killer.\"  If they say the desire even still, he should accept from them, as it says (Deuteronomy 19:4), \"This is the matter of the killer.\"  They would pay rent to the Levites, these are the words of Rabbi Judah.  Rabbi Meir says:  they do not pay them rent.  (When he returns to his city of origin) he returns to the level he had been, these are the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Judah says:  he would not return to the level he had been."

How much must one eat from tevel in order to be culpable? R' Shimon says \"any amount\", and the sages say \"the size of an olive\". R' Shimon said to them, \"Do you not agree that one who eats an ant as it is is culpable?\" They said to him, \"That is because it is a whole.\" He [R' Shimon] said to them, \"One wheat grain is also a whole\".",
            "One who eats (27) first fruits before he has read [the mandated verses] on them, (28) sacrifices with higher sanctity outside the curtains [of the temple], (29) sacrifices with lower sanctity and the second tithe outside the wall [of Jerusalem]. (30) One who breaks the bones of a ritually pure Passover sacrifice; one who does [any of] these is lashed 40 [lashes]. But one who leaves over a pure [Passover sacrifice] until morning and one who breaks the bones of an impure [Passover sacrifice] is not lashed with 40 [lashes].",
            "One who takes a mother [bird from] above her sons, R' Yehuda says, \"He gets let lashed and does not send [the mother bird away].\" And the sages say, \"He sends [the mother bird away] and does not get lashed.\" This is the rule: For any negative commandment that has a [positive] \"go and do\" [aspect to it], one is not culpable for [violating] it [by being punished by lashes].",

If he made one cut because of [mourning for] five dead people, or five cuts because of [mourning for] one dead person, he is liable for each one.

[For destroying] his beard, [he is liable] twice here and twice there, and one at the bottom [i.e. the various corners of the face].

Don't become impure!\" and he became impure, he is liable for each and every one. [Numbers 6:5] If he cut his hair all day, he is only liable for one. If they said to him, \"Don't cut [your hair]! Don't cut [your hair]!\" and he cut, he is liable for each and every one. [Leviticus 19:19, Deuteronomy 22:11] If one wore mixed-fabric garments all day, he is only liable for one.

            "There is [the possibility that one could] plow only one furrow and become liable [on that account] for eight prohibited acts: [This is the case where] one  (1) plows with an ox and a donkey [yoked together] (in violation of Deuteronomy 22:10) (2 and 3) that are [two animals] dedicated to the sanctuary, (4) [plowing] mixed seeds [sown] in a vineyard (in violation of Deuteronomy 22:9), (5) during a Sabbatical year (in violation of Leviticus 25:4), (6) on a Festival-day (in violation of, for example, Leviticus 23:7), (7) [when the plower is] a priest (in violation of Leviticus 21:1) (8) and a Nazirite (in violation of Numbers 6:6) plowing in a contaminated place.   Chananya ben Chachinai says: Also he may have been wearing [while plowing] a garment of mixed [wool and linen] fabrics (in violation of Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:11).  They said to him: This is not in the same category [as the other violations].  He said to them: Neither is the Nazirite in the same category [as the other violations].",

            "[When we assess how many lashes he can take,] we only assess except with a lashes which can be divided into thirds. [If] they assessed him to be able to receive forty, gave him some of the lashes and said \"he is unable to receive forty\", he is exempt [from the rest]. [If] they assessed him to be able to receive eighteen and after they lashed him [the eighteen] they said \"he is able to receive forty\", he is exempt [from receiving any more]. [If] he transgressed a transgression that involved two violations [each of which he'd be culpable forty lashes] and they gave him one assessment [for both], he gets lashed and is exempt [from receiving any more].

And the stone is placed behind him, and the administrator of the gathering stands on it.

And the one who hits, hits with one hand with all his strength.",
            "The reader would read, \"If you do not keep the commandments... God will increase your beatings and the beatings of your children...\"(Deuteronomy 28:58-59) and (if he finished) he would go back to the beginning of the reading.  \"And you shall keep the words of this covenant\" (Deuteronomy 29:9) and he concludes \"The all-merciful one who forgives sin...(Psalms 78:38) and if he finishes he goes back to the beginning.  If he (the one being lashed) died during his whipping, the whipper is not responsible for his death.  If the whipper added an extra strap to the whip and the sinner died the whipper is sent into exile.  If the sinner either soiled or wet himself he is exempt from further lashes.  Rabbi Yehuda says a man is only exempt if he soils himself, but a woman is exempt if she wets herself. ",
            "Anyone who was supposed to be punished with karet but received lashes has their karet removed, as the verse states \"[You shall not exceed forty]...And your brother will be beaten before you (Deuteronomy 25:3)\" - once he has been beaten he becomes like your brother, so says Rabbi Chanania ben Gamliel.  Rabbi Chanania ben Gamliel stated, If someone could lose their life for committing just one sin, one who keeps one commandment, how much more so will his life reward be. Rabbi Shimon says, We learn (that he gains life) from the place [where we learn about the punishment of karet] as it says (Leviticus 18:5) \"They will be cut off the souls...that man should do them and live by them.\"  From this we learn whoever sits and does not sin, he is given reward as if he fulfilled a commandment.  Rabbi Shimon bar Rebbi says, the verse states (Deuteronomy 12:23) \"Be strong to not eat blood because blood is the life force.\"  Now, if blood, which a person is disgusted by, one who does not eat it receives reward, one who removes himself from stealing and illicit relationships, which one desires and chases after, how much more so will he merit for him and the generations after him till the end of time.",
            "Rabbi Chananaia son of Akashia stated, God wanted to grant merit to Israel, therefore he gave them many laws and commandments as it states, \"Because God wants righteousness he increased the amount of Torah and splendor.\"  (Isaiah 42:21)."
