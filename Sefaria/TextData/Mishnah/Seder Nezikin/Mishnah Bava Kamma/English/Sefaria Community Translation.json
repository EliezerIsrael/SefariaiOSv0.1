            "Four categories of damages: The ox, the pit, the grazer, and the fire.  The [characteristics] of the ox are not similar to the [characteristics] of the grazer.  And the [characteristics] of the grazer are not similar to the [characteristics] of the ox.  Nor are either of these, which have a living spirit, similar to the fire, which has no living spirit.  Nor are any of these, which move and do damage, similar to the pit, which does not move and does damage.  What is common among them is that they do damage, and the responsibility for their supervision is upon you. And when they do damage, the damager must pay from the best of the land.",

            "Five [agents of damage] rank as harmless and five as an attested danger.  \nCattle are not an attested danger to butt, push, bite, lie down, or kick.  \nThe tooth [of an animal] is an attested danger to eat that which is for it; \nThe leg [of  an animal] is an attested danger to break [things] as it walks along;\nSo also is a warned ox [an ox that has gored before]; \nAnd an ox that damages in the domain of the damaged party,\nand human beings.  \nThe wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the panther and the snake all rank as attested danger.  Rabbi Eliezer says:  When they are tame they are not attested danger, but the snake is always an attested danger.  \nWhat is the difference between that which is  harmless and that which is an attested danger?  The harmless pays half-damages from its own body and the attested danger pays full damages from the best property (of its owner and guardian).\n"

If it eats clothing or utensils [various items], the owner must pay half the damages.  In what context is this true? - in the domain of the damaged.  However, if it happened in the public domain, the owner would be exempt; except, that is, for the amount of money the owner has now saved in feed cost for the animal, which he should pay back to the damaged party.  When is this true? - If the animal ate in the middle of the street, then only that which the owner saved in food-costs need be paid back.

If the ox gores, pushes, bites, crouches, [or] kicks (all these are later classified as similar to \"horn\", i.e., damage caused through unusual behavior) -- in the public domain, he [the owner] pays full damages.   In the domain of the damaged party, Rabbi Tarfon says [the owner pays] full damages, while The Sages say, [the owner pays] half-damages.  Rabbi Tarfon said to them [using a fortiori reasoning], in a case where we are lenient with respect to \"tooth\" and \"leg\" [damages caused by normal behavior] in the public domain, where he [the owner] is completely exempt, we are strict regarding the private domain of the damaged party, [requiring the owner] to pay full damages. In a case where we are strict with \"horn\" damage [damage from unusual behavior, as described above] in the public domain, [requiring the owner] to pay half-damages, isn't it logical [a fortiori] that we should be strict with him in the domain of the injured party to pay full damages?

Just as in the public domain [the payment for \"horn\" damage is] half-damages, so too in the domain of the damaged party [the payment for \"horn\" damage is] half-damage.  He [R Tarfon] said to them [The Sages], I will not derive \"horn\" [damage] from \"horn\" damage, I will derive \"horn\" damage from \"leg\" damage.

            "One who injures his fellow is liable concerning him for five categories [of payment]: 'damages (nezek)', 'pain (tza'ar)', 'healthcare (ripui)', 'unemployment (shevet)', and 'shame (boshet)'. For damages, how does this work? One who puts out his eye, cuts off his hand, breaks his leg—we see him as if he were a slave sold in the marketplace, and we evaluate how much he was worth before [the injury] and how much he is worth now. Pain? When he burned him with a spit or a nail—even on his fingernail—anything where there is no [permanent] wound, we evaluate how much a person would want to pay to be spared this [pain]. Healthcare? When he strikes him, he is liable for his healthcare costs. If swellings grew on him, if it was because of the strike, then he is liable; but if it was not because of the strike, he is exempt. The swelling emerges and then is hidden, emerges and then is hidden: he is liable for his healthcare. Unemployment? We see him as if he were a cucumber watcher, since he already give him the value of his hand or his leg. Shame? All depends on the one who shames and the one who is shamed. One who shames a naked person, a blind person or a sleeping person is liable. If a sleeping person embarrasses, he is exempt.  One who falls from the roof and is damaged and shamed, he is liable for damages and exempt for shame, as it is written, \"[when two men fight and the wife of one comes out to save her husband,] and she puts out her hand and seizes his genitals (lit. damages his shame) [you shall cut off her hand]\" (Deuteronomy 25:11-12). No one is liable for shame unless they intended [to shame someone].",

            "One who strikes his father or his mother but doesn't cause a [permanent] wound, and one who wounds his fellow on Yom Kippur, he is liable for all [five]. One who wounds a Hebrew slave, he is liable in all [five] except for unemployment—[only] when the slave is his. One who wounds a gentile slave belonging to another, he is liable in all [five]. Rabbi Yehudah says: \"Slaves don't have shame\".",
            "A deaf person, a dullard and a minor: their strikes are bad. One who injures them is liable, and if they injure others they are exempt. The slave and the woman: their strikes are bad. One who injures them is exempt, and when they injure others they are exempt. However, they [might] pay after some time—[if the] woman becomes divorced or the slave is freed, then they are liable to pay.",
            "One who strikes his father or his mother and causes for them a [permanent] wound, and one who injures his fellow on shabbat, is exempt from all [five] because he will be judged for his life. One who injures his own gentile slave, he is exempt from all [five].",
            "One who punches his fellow, he gives him a sela (25 zuz). Rabbi Yehudah in the name of Rabbi Yose HaGlili: \"a maneh (100 zuz)\". One who slaps his fellow, he gives him 200 zuz; with the back of the hand, he gives him 400 zuz. If he split his ear, plucked his hair, spit [at him] and his spit touched him, he gives him 400 zuz. [This is the principle]: it is all according to the person's honour. Rabbi Akiva says: \"Even the poor of Israel, we see them as if they are free people who have lost their property, because they are children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\" There was an incident of someone uncovering the head of a woman in the marketplace. She came before Rabbi Akiva, and he required him to give her 400 zuz. He said to him, \"Rabbi, give me time.\" So he gave him time. [The man] watched her stand at the entrance of her courtyard, broke a pitcher in front of her, and in it was an 'As' of oil. She uncovered her head and she used her palms to collect [the oil], and rubbed her hands on her head. Witnesses testified about her, and he came before Rabbi Akiva. He said to him, \"Rabbi, to her I gave 400 zuz?!\" He replied, \"You haven't said anything. One who injures himself, even though he is not permitted, he is exempt. Others who injure him are liable. And one who cuts his own shoots, even though he is not permitted, he is exempt. Others [who cut his shoots] are liable.",
            "Even when he gives him [the payment], he will not be forgiven until he seeks it from him, as it says, \"Therefore, restore [Abraham's] wife[—he is a prophet and will intercede for you]\" (Genesis 20:7). And where do we know that cruel people will not be forgiven? As it says, \"Abraham prayed to God and God healed Avimelech\" (Genesis 20:17). One who says, \"Put out my eye,\" \"Cut off my hand,\" \"Break my leg,\" he is liable. [One who says, \"Put out my eye] on the condition that you will be exempt,\" he is liable. \"Tear my clothes,\" \"Break my vessel\", he is liable. \"[Tear my clothes] on the condition that you will be exempt,\" he is exempt. \"Do this to so-and-so on the condition that you will be exempt,\" he is liable whether it is his body or his property.
