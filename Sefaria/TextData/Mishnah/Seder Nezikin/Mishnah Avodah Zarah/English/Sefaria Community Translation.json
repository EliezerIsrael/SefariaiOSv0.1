            "All images are prohibited, for the reason that each one is worshiped once in the year. Said Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say not all images are prohibited but only the ones who have a stick (staff) in its hand, or a bird, or an orb. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says anything that has anything in its hand (is prohibited).",
            "If one finds a broken image (fragments), see, it is permitted. If one finds the form of a hand or the form of a foot, see, these are prohibited. Because it is derived from transgression (has been worshiped).",
            "If one finds a vessel and on it a drawing of the sun or a drawing of the moon, or a drawing of a dragon, he should cast them into the Salt Sea. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says; if they are treated with honor, they are forbidden, if they are treated disparagingly, they are permitted. Rabbi Yose says; One should pulverize it (the vessel) and scatter it in the wind or cast it into the sea. The Sages said; Even though it might become manure? As it is said: \"And let nothing of the ban cling to your hand\" (Deuteronomy 13:18).",
            "Proklos son of Plosfos asked Rabban Gamliel, in Akko, while he was bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite.  He said to him: \"If it is written in your Torah (Deuteronomy 3:18): 'None of the condemned things are to be found in your hand,' then why are you bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite?  He said to him: [Questions] are not answered in the bathhouse. When he left, he said to him:  \"I did not come into her territory.  She came into mine.  They didn't say: 'Let us make a bathhouse for the beauty of Aphrodite.'  They said: 'Let us make Aphrodite for the beauty of the bathhouse.' Another reason:  If they gave you a lot of money, you wouldn't perform your idolatry naked and defiled, and you wouldn't urinate in front of it.  Yet, it stands on the sewer pipe and everyone urinates in front of her.  The verse only refers to gods.  If you act as if it is a god, it is forbidden.  If you act as though it is not a god, it is permitted.\"",
            "Because [some] non-Jews worship mountains and hills, the hills and mountains themselves are permitted [to derive benefit from], but anything that is on them is forbidden [to derive benefit from], as it says (Deuteronomy 7:25): \"You shall not covet the gold and silver that is upon them and take it.\" Rabbi Yossi the Galilean said (Deuteronomy 12:2): \"'Their gods are on the mountains,' but the mountains are not their gods, their gods are 'on the hills', but the hills are not their gods\". And why are Asherah trees forbidden [to derive benefit from]? Because they catch people's attention, they are forbidden. Rabbi 'Akiva said: Speaking as your leader, everywhere that you find a tall mountain, a raised hill, or a beautiful tree, know that there is idol worship there.",
            "One whose house is next to a house of idol worship, and the house falls, it is forbidden to rebuild it. What should he do? Gather up the material that is his (within 6-8 feet of his holdings) and rebuild it. If some of the material belongs to both him and the house of idol worship, they should discuss dividing it in half. The stones, wood, and dust have the ritual impurity of vermin, as it says (Deuteronomy 7:26): \"You shall utterly detest it.\" Rabbi Akiva says: [it has the ritual impurity of] menstruating woman, as it says (Isaiah 30:22): \"You will banish them like a menstruating woman. ‘Get out!’ you will say to it.” Just as a menstruating woman renders objects impure by contact, so too does idol worship render objects impure by contact.",
            "There are three [types of] houses. A house that is built for idolatry from the start is prohibited. If the paint and molding are new and dedicated to idolatry, what is new is removed. If idols are brought inside and removed, [the house is] permitted. There are three [types of] stones. A stone hewed to be a pedestal [for an idol] is prohibited. If the paint and molding [are new] and are dedicated to idolatry, what is new is removed. If idols are put on and taken off, [the stone is] permitted. There are three [types of] <i>asherot</i>. A tree planted for idolatry from the start is prohibited. If the pruning and trimming are dedicated to idolatry and it sprouted, the new growth is removed. If idols are put underneath and taken away, [the tree is] permitted. What is an <i>asherah</i>? Every [tree] that has idolatry underneath. Rabbi Shim'on says: \"Every [tree] that is worshipped.\" It happened in Tzidon that they found a pile of stones below a tree that was worshipped. Rabbi Shim'on said to them: \"Check the pile of stones.\" They checked and found an image. He said to them: \"Remove the image they worshiped, and the tree is permitted.\"",
            "One should not sit in [an <i>asherah</i>'s] shadow, but the one who does so remains pure. One should not pass underneath it, and the one who does so becomes impure. If it encroaches on public [property], the one who passes beneath it remains pure. Vegetables may be sown underneath it in the rainy season but not in the hot season. Lettuce can [be sown] neither in the hot season nor in the rainy season. Rabbi Yossi says: \"Even vegetables may not [be sown] in the rainy season, because the leaves fall on them and become fertilizer.\"",
            "If one took some wood from it, it is prohibited for benefit.  If one used [the wood] to heat a new oven, it must be broken up; for an old oven, it must be cooled down.  If one baked bread in it, it is prohibited for benefit, and if that loaf were mixed in with others, they are all prohibited for enjoyment.  Rabbi Eliezer said: Let him throw the \"enjoyment\" into the Dead Sea!  They said to him: There is no redemption [fee] when it comes to idolatry.  If one took wood from it for a loom, it is prohibited for benefit; if he wove a garment on it, the garment is prohibited for enjoyment.  If that garment were mixed in with others, and then all of those were mixed in with still others, they are all prohibited for benefit.  Rabbi Eliezer said: Let him throw the \"benefit\" into the Dead Sea!  They said to him: There is no redemption [fee] when it comes to idolatry.",
            "How does one annul [a tree used for idol-worship]? If one trims or prunes, or removed a branch or a stick - or even a leaf - it is annulled.  If he trimmed it for the tree's own [visual] sake, it is prohibited, but if not for the tree's sake, then it is permitted."

            "Rabbi Yishmael says, three stones lying next to each other lying next to Markulis [an idol] are prohibited [they are an idol], if there were only two, they are permitted.  The Sages say, those that seem to be with [the idol] are prohibited, but those that do not appear to be with it are permitted.",
            "If he found on its [the idols] head clothing or utensils, they are permitted [for benefit], if he found grape vines or crowns of wheat stalks, or wine, oil or flour, or anything which is normally brought on the alter, they are prohibited.",
            "An idol that had a garden or a bath house, one can benefit from it if they did not have to pay but they cannot benefit from it if they would have to pay.  If they belonged to an idol and to others, they can benefit from them regardless of whether they would have to pay for them.",
            "The idol of a non-Jew is automatically forbidden [from benefit].  If it belonged to a Jew, it only becomes forbidden once it is worshiped.  A non-Jew can nullify his idol and his friends idol, but a Jew cannot nullify the idol of a non-Jew.  One who nullifies an idol also nullifies the instruments used to serve it.  If he just nullified the instruments, they are nullified but the idol is still forbidden [from benefit].",
            "How does one nullify [an idol]? If he cut off the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, the tip of a finger, or if he dented it even though he did not remove anything it is nullified.  If he spat before it or urinated before it, if he dragged it [on the ground] or if he threw excrement at it, it is not nullified.  If he sold it or used it as collateral Rebbi says it is nullified, but the sages say it is not nullified.  ",
            "An idol whose worshipers abandoned it during a time of peace becomes permitted [for benefit], if it was a time of war, it remains prohibited. Royal pillars [upon which idols would be placed] are permitted, because they only are built when the king is passing.",
            "They asked the elders of Rome, if [Hashem] does not want idol worship, why does he not destroy the idols.  They answered if they were worshiping things which the world does not need, he would in fact destroy them, but they are worshiping the sun, the moon the stars and the constellations, should the whole world be destroyed because of the fools?  They answered if so, why does he not destroy those idols that the world does not need and leave the ones that the world does?  They answered, then he would strengthen the faith of those who worship them because they would say, \"this is the proof they are real gods since they were not destroyed\". ",
            "One may buy a stepped on wine press from a non-Jew even though he uses his hand [to take the crushed grapes] and places them in the pile.  It does not become \"Nesech\" wine [wine which is forbidden because it might have been poured before an idol] until it drains to the pit.  Once it has drained to the pit, [if the non-Jew touches it] what is in it is forbidden [from benefit] and the rest is permitted. ",
            "One can press grapes with a non-Jew in the wine press, but he cannot harvest with him.  A Jew who makes [his wine] while impure, one may not press or harvest with him, but one can send him barrels to the wine press and take them out of the wine press with him.  A baker who makes [his bread] while impure, one may not knead or shape the dough with him, but he can bring the bread with him to the seller. ",
            "A non-Jew who was found next to a pit of wine, if he has a lein upon the wine it is prohibited,  if he does not then it is permitted.  If he fell into the pit and climbed out or he measured the wine with a reed, or he flicked out a bug with a reed or if he was tapping on a boiling barrel, in all of these cases, they said to sell the wine.  Rabbi Shimon says it is permitted.  If he took the barrel and threw it into the pit, this case happened and they permitted it. ",
            "One who prepares wine for a non-Jew and places it in his domain in a house that is open to the public domain, in a city that had both Jews and non-Jews it is permitted.  In a city that is entirely non-Jews it is forbidden unless a guard was placed there. The guard does not have to be there constantly, even if he is entering and exiting it is still permitted.  Rabbi Shimon son of Elazar said all domains of non-Jews are like one domain.",
            "One who prepares wine for a non-Jew and places it in his domain, and the non-Jew writes a receipt that he received the money, it is permitted.  But if the Jew wanted to remove the wine [from his property] and the non-Jew does not let him until he receives his payment, this once happened in Beit She'an and the sages made it prohibited.  "

            "One who hires a worked to work with him with Nessech wine, his salary is prohibited.  If he was hired to perform a different task, even if he said to him move that barrel of Nesech wine from one place to another his salary is permitted.  One who rents a donkey to transport Nesech wine its rental fee is prohibited.  If it was rented to ride on, even though the non-Jew used it to transport his flask [of Nesech wine], its rental fee is permitted.",

[if they fell on figs or dates, if there is enough wine to impart its flavor (into the fruit) it is prohibited]. It once happened to Baytus Son of Zonin that brought dried figs on a boat and a barrel of Nesech wine burst and fell on them and he asked the sages and they permitted [the dried figs].  This is the rule, if there is increased enjoyment due to the imparted flavor it is prohibited, but if not it is permitted, like the case of vinegar falling on beans.",
            "A non-Jew who was transporting jugs of wine with a Jew from one place to another, if there was a constant guard on them they are permitted.  If he let him know that he was going away [they are prohibited if there was enough time] to puncture [the seal] patch it and allow it to dry.

Rabbi Shimon son of Gamliel says it must be enough time for him to open [the deal] create a new one and allow it to dry.

            "Jewish workers whom a non-Jew paid in Nesech wine, they can say to him give us its value, but once it enters their domain, it becomes prohibited.  One who sells his wine to a non-Jew if he set the price before measuring the volume the fee is permitted, but if he measured before setting the price, the fee is prohibited.  If he took a funnel and measured the wine into a non-Jews jug and then into a Jews jug if the funnel has a wine catcher it is prohibited, if he pours from one container to another, what is in the one he poured from is permitted, but what is in the one he poured into is prohibited.
