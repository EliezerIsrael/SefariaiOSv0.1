If he was impure and knew so, and then the impurity was forgotten to him but the (fact that this building is) the Temple was remembered, (or) if (he was impure and knew so and the fact that this building is) the Temple was forgotten to him but the impurity was remembered, (or) if both were forgotten to him, and (in any of these cases) he entered the Temple without knowing, and once he had eaten he knew (both the impurity and that this building is the Temple)--such a person is obligated to offer a Variable Offering.",

And the court would walk with the two Thanksgiving Offerings behind them, and all of the Jewish people behind them. The inner (Thanksgiving Offering) was eaten, and the outer (Thanksgiving Offering) was burned. And any (extension) that was made without any of these, one who enters there (while impure) is not liable for doing so.",

And if she claims it not in her husbands presence she must claim it through swearing.  Similarly orphans cannot claim their fathers loans without swearing.  They must swear that their father did not tell them at the time of death that his debts were paid and that their father did not tell them beforehand that the debts were paid and that they didnt find among his contracts that this contract was already paid.  Rabbi Yochanan son of Broka says even if a son was born after the father died, he must swear to collect any of his fathers debts.  Raban Shimon son of Gamliel says if there are witnesses that said that at the time of the father's death he said that this contract was not repaid, the son can reclaim the debts without swearing. ",
            "The following must swear without being claimed from: partners, sharecroppers, managers of orphan's estates a woman who manages money in the house and a son of the house [after the father's death]  If [any of these people] said what claim do you have against me? and he answers I want you to swear to me, [these people] are liable to swear.  If the partners or share croppers split their property he cannot make them swear.  If an oath was required of [the partner] for a different reason he can make him swear for everything.  The Shmita year cancels all oaths [for old debts]."

            "There are four types of watchers, an unpaid watchmen, a borrower, a paid watchmen and a renter.  An unpaid watchmen swears for all types of cases [to exempt himself from payment], the borrower pays in all cases.  A paid watchmen and a renter take an oath in the case of the animal breaking a limb, being captured [by an army] or if it dies but pay in the case of the animal being lost of stolen.  ",
            "If he said to the unpaid watchman where is my ox and he said it died, but it really broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or was lost.  Or he claimed it broke a limb but it really died or was captured or stolen or was lost.  It was captured, but really it died or broke a limb or was stolen or was lost. It was stolen but really it died or broke a limb or was captured or was lost.  It was lost but really it died or was broken or captured or stolen, and the owner said swear to me and he said ok, the watchman is exempt (from a sacrifice). ",
            "If he asked where is my ox? and [the unpaid watchman] said to him I dont know what you're talking about but really it died or broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or was lost, and the owner said swear to me and he said ok, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].  If he asked where is my ox and he answered it was lost, if he said swear to me and he said ok but witnesses testify that he really ate it, the watchman pays the value of the ox.  If he admitted on his own he pays the value of the ox plus a fifth of its value and must bring an asham.  If he asked, where is my ox and he answered it was stolen, he said swear to me and the watchman said ok but witnesses testify that he really stole it he must pay double the value of the ox.  If he admitted on his own he pays the value of the ox plus a fifth of its value and must bring an asham.",
            "If he said to someone in the marketplace where is my ox you stole?  And he says I did not steal it and witnesses testify that he did steal it the thief must pay double [the value of the ox].  If he slaughtered it and sold it he pays four or five times [its value].  If he saw witnesses coming and he said I stole it but did not slaughter or sell it, he only pays the principle.  ",
            "If he asked the borrower where is my ox? and he answered it died, but really it broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or lost.  It broke a limb but really it died or was captured or was stolen or was lost.  It was captured but really it died or it broke a limb or it was stolen or it was lost.  It was stolen but really it died or broke a limb or was captured or lost.  It was lost but really it died or broke a limb or was captured or lost and he said swear to me and the watchman said ok, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].",
            "If he asked [the borrower] where is my ox, and he said I dont know what you're talking about, but really it died or broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or lost and he said swear to me and the borrower said ok he is obligated [to bring a sacrifice]. \nIf he said to the paid watchmen or the renter where is my ox? and he said it died, but really it broke a limb or was captured.  It broke a limb but really it died or was captured. It was captured, but really it died or broke a limb. It was stolen but really it was lost. It was lost but really it was stolen if he says swear to me and he says ok, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].  If he said it died or broke a limb or was captured but really it was stolen or lost and he said swear to me and he said ok, he is obligated [to bring a sacrifice].  If he said it was lost or stolen but really it died or broke a limb or was captured and he said swear to me and he said ok, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].  This is the rule, any claim that changes from a case of being obligated [to pay] to a case of being obligated or from a case of being exempt to a case of being exempt or from being exempt to being obligated is exempt [from a sacrifice].  From being obligated to exempt, he is obligated [to bring a sacrifice].  [This is the rule, whoever swears to lighten his burden is obligated (to bring a sacrifice) to make their burden greater is exempt (from bringing a sacrifice).]"
