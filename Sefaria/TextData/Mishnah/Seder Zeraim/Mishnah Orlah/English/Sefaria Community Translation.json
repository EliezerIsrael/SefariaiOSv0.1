            "Terumah and Terumat Ma`aser of Demai, Halla and Bikkurim are nullified in one hundred and one parts, and they are mixed together and require elevation.  `Orlah and Kilai hakerem (=forbidden mixtures of the vineyard) are nullified in two hundred and one parts, and they are mixed together, and they do not require elevation.  Rabbi Shimon says they are not mixed together.  Rabbi Eliezer says they are mixed with the giver of flavor, but not to forbid.",
            "Terumah can bring up orlah, and orlah can bring up terumah.  How so?  A seah of terumah which fell into one hundred, and afterwards three kavs of orlah or three kavs of mixed seed in the vineyard fell in.  This is [an instance] where terumah can bring up orlah, and orlah can bring up terumah. ",
            "Orlah can bring up mixed seeds (kilayim), and kilayim [can bring up] orlah, and orlah [can bring up] orlah.    How so? A seah of orlah which falls into two hundred [seahs] and afterwards a seah and a little bit more of orlah falls in, or a seah and a little bit more of kilayim of the vineyard. This is [a case] where orlah can bring up kilayim, and kilayim [can bring up] orlah, and orlah [can bring up] orlah.  ",
            "Whatever causes something to ferment, or seasons, or wmakes a forbidden mixture when mixed with terumah or with orlah or with ‘mixed-seeds’ of the vineyard, is prohibited. Bet Shammai says: it also defiles. But Bet Hillel says: it does not defile unless it has the volume of an egg. ",
            "Dostai a man of the village of Yitmah was one of the disciples of Bet Shammai, and he said, “I received a tradition from Shammai the elder who said: “It never defiles unless it contains the volume of an egg.”  ",
            "Concerning what did they say: “Whatever causes something to ferment, or seasons, or makes a forbidden mixture when mixed (with terumah or with orlah or with ‘mixed-seeds’ of the vineyard,) the rule is stringent”?  [In the case of] a species [mixed] with its [like] species. [When did they say] “the rule is [sometimes] lenient and [sometimes] stringent”?  [In the case of] a species [mixed] with a different kind of species.  How so?  If leaven of wheat fell into wheat dough and there is enough to cause leavening, whether there is enough to take out due to a ratio one-hundred-and-one, or there is not enough to take out due to a ratio of one-hundred-and-one, it is prohibited. If there is not enough to take out due to a ratio in one-hundred-and-one, whether there is enough to cause leavening, or there is not enough to cause leavening, it is prohibited.   ",
            "(The latter teaching of the mishna teaches to yield both a lenient and a strict ruling, in the case of one kid of produce mixed with produce of the same kind). If crushed beans (which are terumah) were cooked with lentils (which are not terumah), and they imparted flavor (to the lentils), whether there was little enough terumah to be neutralized in one hundred and one, or whether there is not so little terumah to be neutralized in one hundred and one, it is forbidden (strict ruling). If there is not enough of them to impart flavor to the lentils, whether there is so little terumah as is neutralized in one hundred and one, or whether there is not little enough terumah to be neutralized in one hundred and one, the mixture is permitted (lenient ruling). ",
            "One who takes leaven out of dough from which hallah had not been removed and puts it into dough from which hallah had been removed: If he has a supply from another place, he can take out [hallah] in accordance with the precise amount.    But if he does not, he takes out one [portion of] hallah for the whole [dough]. ",
            "If leaven of non-sacred produce has fallen into dough and caused it to ferment, and after that leaven of terumah or of mixed seeds of the vineyard fell in, and there was enough to cause leavening, [the dough] is prohibited. But Rabbi Shimon permits it. ",
            "If spices of the terumah and if mixed-seeds (kilayim) of the vineyard have fallen into a pot, and each individually does not have a sufficient quantity to properly season, but together, they did cause proper seasoning, it is forbidden to non-kohanim, but permitted to kohanim. Rabbi Shimon allows it to both priests and non-priests..",
            "If a piece of the flesh of the highhest degree of sanctity, or of pigul (where a sacrifice was offered with the improper intent of eating it after its limit), or notar (flesh leftover after its time limit, both of which are forbidden to priests and non-priests) have been cooked with pieces of non-sacred flesh, the non-sacred flesh is impermissible to non-kohanim, but permissible to kohanim. Rabbi Shimon permits for both non-kohanim and kohanim. ",
            "...Spices of two or three (categories of prohibitions), of one species, or of three different species of spices (of one category of prohibition), render a mixture prohibited by combining together. Rabbi Shimon says: the mixture of two or three categories of prohibition of one species, or two species of one category of prohibition do not combine together.",
            "If leaven of hullin, and of terumah, fell into a dough and individually, each does not have a sufficient quantity to cause fermentation, but taken together, they did cause fermentation, Rabbi  Eliezer says: \"I go after the last one that fell,\" but the sages say, \"Regardless of whether the forbidden leaven fell in first, or last, never does the dough become prohibited, unless there is a sufficient amount to cause fermentation (on its own).   ",
            "...Yoezer,  a man of Birah, was one of the disciples of the House of Shammai, and said: I asked Rabban Gamliel the Elder, as he was standing at the Eastern Gate, and he said: \"Regardless of whether the forbidden fell in first, or last, never does the dough become prohibited, unless there is a sufficient amount to cause fermentation.\" ",
            "If one oiled vessels in order to soften them, with impure oil, and then he later re-oiled them with pure oil, or if one first oiled with pure oil, and afterwards, oiled them with impure oil, Rabbi Eliezer says, \"I go after the first,\" while the sages say that they go after the last. ...",
            " If leaven of terumah and leaven of klei hakerem (kilayim of the grapevine) fell into a dough and each individually does not have enough of a quantity to effect fermentation, but together, they did cause fermentation, the dough is prohibited to non-kohanim, and permitted to kohanim Rabbi Shimon allows for both non-kohanim and kohanim. ",
            "If a piece of flesh of the most sanctified of sacrifices and a piece of flesh from  a lesser level of sanctity have been cooked together with nonsanctified flesh (permitted to all), it is forbidden to the impure, but permitted for the pure."

            "A garment that has been dyed using peels of an Orla tree must be burnt. If [this garment] got mixed in with other [garments], they must all be burnt, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, it becomes void with [a pile of] 201[other such garments].",
            "One who dyes [a thread] the length of a 'sit' with peels of an Orla tree, and then wove them into a garment, but he doesn't know which [thread] it is, Rabbi Meir says, he must burn the garment. And the Sages say, it becomes void among 201 [other such garments].",
            "One who weaves a [thread] the length of a 'sit' from the wool a firstborn animal into a garment, he must burn the garment. [if the thread was from] the hair of a Nazirite or from a [first born] donkey which needs redemption [and he sewed it] into a sack, he must burn the sack. And [with regards to] holy items, they sanctify [whatever they are sewed into], independent of the quantity.",
            "A cooked item which is cooked with the peels of an Orla tree must be burnt. If [the cooked item] gets mixed with other [such cooked items], it becomes void [when there are] 201 [other such cooked items].",
            "An oven which was lit with shells of Orlah, and bread was baked in it, the bread should be burned. If that bread was mixed with others, it is nullified one in two hundred.",
            "Someone who has bundles of fenugreek which come from a Kilayim vineyard, he must burn them. If [these bundles] got mixed with other [such bundles], they must all be burnt, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. And the sages say, they are void in a [pile of] 201 [other such bundles].",
            "Rebbe Meir used to say, if it is the normal way to count (an object individually), then it renders everything as holy (and thereby forbidden). The Sages say that only six things render everything as holy. And Rebbe Akiva says there are seven. They are, \"perech\" nuts, Badan pomegranates, sealed jars, beet shoots, cabbage heads, Greek gourds. Rebbe Akiva says, loaves of bread of homeowners. That which is fit for orlah is orlah. That which is fit for kilei hakerem is kilei hakerem.",
            "(How so)? If nuts split, pomegranates separate, barrels open, gourds are cut, loaves of bread are crumbled, they are nullified one in two hundred.",
            "If there is a doubt about [whether or not a certain fruit is] Orla, in Israel it is forbidden [to have benefit from it] and a in Suria it is permitted and outside Israel, he can go down [to the market] and buy it, as long as he doesn't see him picking it. A vineyard that has vegetables planted in it [rendering them Kilayim] in Israel they are forbidden [from benefit] and in Suria they are permitted and outside Israel he can go down [to the market] and buy them as long as he doesn't pick them himself. New [wheat] is forbidden by law of the Torah everywhere. But Orla and Kilayim or forbidden by law of the Rabbis."
