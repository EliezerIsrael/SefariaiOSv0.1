            "The Rabbi's taught: There were four who entered the Pardes (sublime orchard) and they are - Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Acher (Alisha Ben Avuya) and Rabbi Akiva. Before they entered, Rabbi Akiva said to them: \"When you reach near the pure marble stones, do not say \"water water\", because it says \"a speaker of lies shall not abide before my eyes\".",
            "Ben Azzai glanced and died ... Ben Zoma glanced and became unstable ... Acher chopped down saplings. R' Akiva emerged in peace."
