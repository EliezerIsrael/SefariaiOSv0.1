            "Mishnah: Seven days before the Day of Atonement, the High-priest was removed from his house to the Palhedrin (counsellors') chamber, and another High-priest was appointed to substitute him in case he should meet with such an accident [as would incapacitate him for the service of that day]. R. Juda says:  \"Another wife was also appointed for him lest his own wife should meanwhile die, whereas it is said (Lev. 17:11) 'And he shall make atonement for himself and for his house;' 'his house' alludes to his wife.'\" \"If this be so,\" the sages remarked, \"then there will be no end to the matter [the other wife may also die].\"",
