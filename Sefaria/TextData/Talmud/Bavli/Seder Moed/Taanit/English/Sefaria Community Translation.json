            "...R. Nachman said to R. Yitzchak, What is the meaning of the verse, And it came to pass when Samuel was old. Did Samuel become old? He lived only for fifty-two years. As it was said, If a man dies at age 52 he is said to have died at the age reached by Shmuel, the Ramati? [R. Yitzchak] said,  R. Yochanan said, Old age jumped upon him, as it is written, I regret that I made Shaul King. [Shmuel] said, Lord of the World, You have equated me with Moshe and Aharon, as it is said  Moshe and Aharon are among God’s priests, and Shmuel among those who call in God’s name. Just as with Moshe and Aharon, their handiwork was not canceled in their time, so too let my handiwork not be canceled in my lifetime. God said, How shall I act? Should Shaul die? Shmuel will not allow it. Should Shmuel die young? People will cast aspersions on him. Should neither Shmuel nor Shaul die? The time has come for David to reign and one kingship may not encroach on another even by a hair's breadth. God said: I will cause old age to jump on [Shmuel]."
