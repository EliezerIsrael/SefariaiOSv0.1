            "It was said that Rabbi Akiva had twelve thousand pairs of disciples, from Gabbat  to Antifaras;  and they all died at the same time because they did not treat each other with respect. The world remained desolate  until Rabbi Akiva came to our Masters in the South and taught the Torah to them. These were Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Judah, Rabbi Yossi, Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Eleazar ben Shammua; and it was they who revived the Torah at that time. A Tanna taught: All of them  died between Passover and Pentecost. Rabbi Hama bar Abba or, it might be said, Rabbi Chiyya bar Abin said: All of them died a cruel death. What was it? — Rabbi Nahman replied: Croup."
