            "Rava raised an objection to Rav Chisda (from the following verse): \"Behold, you should die because of the woman you have taken.\" Does this not mean that he should die at the hands of humans? No, (it means that he should die) at the hands of heaven. However, the language is precise, as it says, \"(I stopped you) from sinning against Me (the Me in this sentence is God, which would imply that obviously God is the one who actually punishes).\" But according to your opinion, (regarding the verse about Joseph speaking of adultery says) \"I sinned against God,\" this means against God and not against man! Rather, the judgment comes through humans! So too here, it is where judgment comes through humans!",
            "Abaya raised an objection to Rava. (In the verse referring to Avimelech, he says to God), \"would You execute a nation that is righteous?\" There (God) responded to him, \"and now return the man's wife for he is a prophet!\""
        ],
        [
            "Could it be that it is only (in the case of ) the wife of a prophet that you must return her, but one who is not a prophet you don't need to return (his wife)? Rather, it is like that which was said by Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachamni! For Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachamni said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: this is what was said (by God to Avimelech) \"but now return the man's wife\" - in any instance. And regarding that which you said, \"would You execute a nation though he is innocent? Did he not tell me, 'She is my sister!'\" He (Avraham) is a prophet, and from you one should learn, when a visitor comes to a city, regarding maters of food and drink you should ask him, but you should not ask him \"is this your wife or your sister?\" From here we learn that a person subject to the Noahide laws is executed, because he should've learned, but he did not learn.
