And from then on the time has passed, as that time is no longer the time of lying down and is not referred to when the Torah says \"And when you lie down.\" And before this time (that is, before the stars come out) also is not the time of lying down. Therefore someone who recites it before then does not fulfill his obligation. If so, why do we read it in the synagogue? In order to stand in prayer from within words of Torah, as is taught in a Braita in Talmud Yerushalmi Masechet Berachot. Therefore, we are obligated to recite it [again] after it becomes dark. And by reading the first paragraph that a person reads on his bed, he fulfills his obligation."
