Therefore someone who recites it before then does not fulfill his obligation. If so, why do we read it in the synagogue? In order to stand in prayer from within words of Torah, as is taught in a Braita in Talmud Yerushalmi Masechet Berachot. Therefore, we are obligated to recite it [again] after it becomes dark. And by reading the first paragraph that a person reads on his bed, he fulfills his obligation."
