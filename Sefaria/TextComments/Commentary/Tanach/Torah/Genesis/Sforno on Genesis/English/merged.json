This is in relation to the demons, who are mortal like human beings, as our Masters, may their memory be a blessing, testified: \"It says, 'to the non-<i>E-loah</i> demons' (Devarim 32:7), while regarding G-d, may He be blessed, it said, <i>E-loah</i>, for He is absolutely eternal, and they said, \"And he abandoned the the Eternal Who created him\" (Devarim 32:15). And it says regarding Him <i>E-lohim</i>, a plural form, to indicate that He is the form of all forms, eternal and otherwise, as it says, \"the fullness of the earth is His Glory\", for there is no existance other than Him, other than that which emanates from His Existence, and there will not exist any existence other than His Existence, as it says, \"and you give life to all of them\" (Nehemiah 9:6). Now, in the sense of similarity, anything separated from the material realm may be called <i>Elohim</i>. Expert judges are called <i>Elohim</i>, when they judge employing the image of G-d. Now to indicate the supremity of His Eternity, from which emanate all other entities separated from the material, He is called \"G-d of gods\" ( <i>E-loahei HaElohim</i>).",

Therefore, <i>shamayim</i> indicates a distant entity (relative to us), equally distant on all sides. This cannot occur except with an encompassing, perfectly round sphere. It is therefore saying that He created this entity which is equidistant from us in all directions - this is the (heavenly) sphere. Therefore it did NOT say \"He created heavens\", for it is not speaking from His perspective, but relative to our situation.",

Thereby, it is explained that the primordial matter was created <i>ex nihilo</i> and the matter of that first compound was called <i>tohu</i> since from its own perspective it was merely potentially [existant], not actually existant, as it says, (regarding false gods) \"for they are <i>tohu</i>, that is to say, without actual existance, rather merely imaginary. Now the form imposed on that first compound was called <i>bohu</i>, for it was \"in <i>tohu</i>\" that it was actually present.

The portion of it close to the water acquired coldness from the water, except for a small portion thereof which was heated incidentally by a reversal of the sparks from the luminous luminaries. "

Now behold, thereby, they [the waters] necessarily ascended to some boundary in the elemental air, and the air necessarily was subject to some transformation which made a place for a portion which was converted to vapor, and it expanded to a place much great in volume than its original place."

But He made it such that that \"firmament\" that separates would have the power to stop and prevent the vaporous portion from descending - that's the \"waters which are above the firmament\", such that the transformed atmospheric portion would descend, while the vaporous would remain in its original place. Because of this, when the the moist vapor reaches it [i.e., the firmament], it condenses and gives rise to rain, snow and hail. As they condense they descend, as it is said, \"at the sound of His placing an abundance of water in the heavens\" Jeremiah 10:13. - what it wanted by saying \"heavens\": the  firmament which condenses the atmospheric part [of the waters], as it is said \"And G-d called the firmament \"heavens\" Genesis 1:8. Now when the cloudy, excited vapor arrives there [at the firmament], it generates thunder and lightning, and it is said: \"He lifts up clouds from the ends of the earth, thunder from the rain He makes\" [continuation of verse quoted previously from Jeremiah]. Now, seeing as how some of the heavier watery element is above the lighter air, which from our perspectives is against their nature - this without doubt indicates the action of an volitional actor, intended such an outcome, as it is said, \"the work of His hands shall the firmament declare\" Psalms 19:2",
