                "...This parsha was written to show how Hashem saved his servant from a stronger foe, and sent his angels to rescue him. In addition it teaches us that he [Jacob] didnt rely on his righteousness, and made every effort to save himself. Another concept alluded to, is that all that occurred to our forefather with Esau, will repeat itself with us and Esau's descendants. It is therefore appropriate for us to emulate the efforts of Yakov who initiated 3 strategies for his encounter with Esau; Prayer, presents, and war. Our sages see this hinted to in this parsha as I will mention later.",

In the Second Temple period, the Hasmonean kings made a treaty with Rome and some of their representatives even went to Rome and in the end, this was the first step of our falling into their hands."
