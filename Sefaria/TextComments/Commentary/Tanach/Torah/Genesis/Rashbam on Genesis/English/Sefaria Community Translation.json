                "Enlightened ones shall understand that all the words of our Masters and their interpretations are true and well-founded. This is what is stated in [the Talmudic tractate] <i>Shabbat</i>: “I was eighteen years old and I didn’t know that Scripture does not depart from its simple meaning…” The essential part of the laws and the interpretations stem from [otherwise] extraneous [phrasings] of Scripture or from a change of language, where the simple meaning of Scripture is written in a manner that enables learning from it the essential part of the interpretation, such as “These are the generations of the heavens and the earth in their bing created <i>b’hibar’am</i> – where the Sages interpreted, “through Avraham” from the extra wording, for it did not need to write <i>b’hibar’am</i>. Now, I will explain the explanations of the early authorities (<i>Rishonim</i>) regarding this verse, making it known to people why I have not seen fit to explain as they did. There are those who explain “At first, G-d created the heavens and the earth”. But it is impossible to say this, for behold, the waters came first, as it is written, “And the spirit of G-d hovered over the4 waters”. And further, what is written here is not “in the beginning”, but rather, “in the beginning of”, which is attached to what follows, such as “And the beginning of his kingdom was Bavel”. Now the one who explains like, “the beginning of G-d’s speaking with Hoshea”, that is, “At the beginning of G-d’s creating the heavens”, that is, “before He created heaven and earth, the earth was void and without form and darkness was over the deep and the spirit of G-d hovered over the waters” so that it turns out that the waters were created first, this is also vanity, for then it would not be appropriate to write, “ and the earth was void and without form”, for since it hadn’t yet been created, it would be inappropriate to call it “earth” before the creation of the waters, since the waters came first. Rather, this is its essential simple meaning: it is the way of Scripture to anticipate and explain something which is not strictly necessary for the sake of something mentioned further on in another place. As it is written, “Shem, Ham and Yefet”, and it is written, “Ham is Kena’an’s father” – for since it is written further on, “cursed is Kena’an”, yet it didn’t explain first who Kena’an is, we wouldn’t know why Noach cursed him. Or: “And he laid with Bilhah, his father’s concubine and Yisrael heard” – why is it written here “and Yisrael heard”? Behold, it isn’t written here that Ya’akov spoke with Re’uven at all? Rather, since at the time of his passing, he said “Unstable as water, you will not have excellence; because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it--he went up to my couch”, therefore, it wrote first the passage “And Yisrael heard”, so that you should not be surprised when you see that he reproves him regarding this at the end of his days. And similarly, in several places. Also the entire passage of the work of the six days Moshe our master wrote first to explain what Hashem said at the time of the giving of the Torah, “Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it…for, six days did Hashem make the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in it, and He rested on the seventh day”. This is why it is written “and it was evening, and it was morning, the sixth day” – that same sixth day which is the conclusion of the six days spoken of at the giving of the Torah.  This is why Moshe said this to the Jewish people, to inform them that the word of the Holy One (praised be He!) is true. Are you of the opinion that this world, all its days, has been [completely] built-up the way you see it now, filled with everything good? It was not like this, rather, \"In the beginning G-d created…\" - that is to say, at the beginning of the creating of heaven and earth - at the time that the supernal heaven and earth were already created - whether that [lasted] a long time or a short time - at that time, the earth was [void and without form]."

                "“And G-d separated between the light and the dark” – such that 12 hours did the day last, and then 12 hours night. Light first, and afterwards, darkness. For, behold, the beginning of the creation of the worlds was with the statement, “Let there be light”. And any darkness that preceded that, as it is written, “and darkness on the face of the deep” – this was not night."

                "“And G-d called the light day” – ask yourself: according to the straightforward meaning, why did G-d need to call the light at the moment of its creation “day”? Rather, this is what Moshe, our master, wrote: everything which we see in the words of the Omnipresent “day”, such as “day and night shall not cease” – that’s referring to the light an dark created on the first day – Hashem calls them in all places “day” and “night”.  And likewise for every “And G-d called” written in this parashah. And likewise, “And Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun: Yehoshua” [referring to] what was stated earlier “for the tribe of Eprhaim – Hoshea bin Nun” – he’s the same one that Moshe called “Yehoshua bin Nun”, whom he appointed previously as servant in his house – for it is the manner of kings when appointing people over their house to renew their names, as it is stated, “And Par’oah called Yosef’s name <i>tzafnat pa’aneach</i>”, “and he called Daniel <i>belshatzar</i>”…",
                "“And it was evening, and it was morning” – It is not written here, “And it was night, and it was day”, but rather, “and it was evening, and it was morning” – the first day became evening and the sun set, and it became morning, the morning following the night, for the dawn broke” – behold, one day was completed from the six that Hashem spoke of in the Ten Commandments, and afterwards began the second day: “G-d said, ‘let there be a firmament’”. The text does not come to state that the evening and the morning are part of a single day, for it only needs to explain how there were six days – that the morning broke and the night was finished: behold, one days was completed and another day began."

Now since he didn’t complete the work of the waters until the third day, when dry land appeared, it does not state “it was good” on the second day, but on the third day it is stated twice, “it was good” – once for the work of the waters and once for the emergence of the trees and grasses.",

The Rishonim, because of their piety busied themselves with the drashot as their focus, and they did not regularly delve into the plain meaning of the text, and because the Chachamim said not to spend too much time with logic and expressed the significance not of learning Torah but of learning Talmud as having no greater measure, they did not regularly engage in establishing the plain meaning of the text. Even Rashi the father of my mother set his heart to explain the plain meaning of the text, even my grandfather Shlomo was an adherent of this school; and I had an argument with him on that account, in which he admitted that he would make new commentaries according to the plain meanings that arise each day."
