This is an allusion (It is the actual statement to the ignorant son, but only alludes to an answer to the evil son because the response is not \"God did for us\" but, rather, \"for me.\") to a response to the evil son, saying: \"Adonai did this for me\" --for had you been there [in Egypt] you would not have been worthy to be redeemed. (Since the Exodus from Egypt was solely so that Israel would fulfill the mitzvot and, since the evil son excludes himself from this, he would not have been worthy of redemption)."
